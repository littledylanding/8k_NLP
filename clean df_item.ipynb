       "  '0000895126-21-000033'): ['Item1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.Exit Credit FacilityOn the Effective Date, pursuant to the terms of the Plan, the Company, as borrower, entered into a reserve-based credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with the lenders party thereto (the “Lenders”), MUFG Bank, Ltd., as administrative agent (in such capacity, the “Administrative Agent”), MUFG Union Bank, N.A., as collateral agent, and acknowledged and agreed to by certain of the Company’s subsidiaries, as guarantors (the “Guarantors”), providing for a reserve-based credit facility (the “Exit Credit Facility”) with an initial borrowing base of $2.5 billion. The borrowing base will be redetermined semiannually on or around May 1 and November 1 of each year, with one interim “wildcard” redetermination available to each of the Company and the Administrative Agent, at the direction of certain lenders, between scheduled redeterminations. The next scheduled redetermination will be on or about October 1, 2021. The aggregate initial elected commitments of the lenders under the Exit Credit Facility will be $1.75 billion of revolving Tranche A Loans (the “Tranche A Loans”) and $0.22 billion of fully funded Tranche B Loans (the “Tranche B Loans”) on the Effective Date.The Exit Credit Facility provides for a $200.0 million sublimit of the aggregate commitments that are available for the issuance of letters of credit. The Exit Credit Facility bears interest at the ABR (alternate base rate) or LIBOR, at our election, plus an applicable margin (ranging from 2.25–3.25% per annum for ABR loans and 3.25–4.25% per annum for LIBOR loans, subject to a 1.00% LIBOR floor), depending on the percentage of the borrowing base then being utilized. The Tranche A Loans mature 3 years after the Effective Date and the Tranche B Loans mature 4 years after the Effective Date. The Tranche B Loans can be repaid if no Tranche A Loans are outstanding.The Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that require the Company and its Guarantors, on a consolidated basis, to maintain (i) a first lien leverage ratio of not more than 2.75 to 1:00, (ii) a total leverage ratio of not more than 3.50 to 1:00, (iii) a current ratio of not less than 1.00 to 1:00 and (iv) except when testing is not required under the Credit Agreement, an asset coverage ratio of not less than 1.50 to 1:00.The Company is required to pay a commitment fee of 0.50% per annum on the average daily unused portion of the current aggregate commitments under the Tranche A Loans. The Company is also required to pay customary letter of credit and fronting fees.The Credit Agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other things, as to compliance with laws (including environmental laws and anti-corruption laws), delivery of quarterly and annual financial statements, conduct of business, maintenance of property, maintenance of insurance, restrictions on the incurrence of liens, indebtedness, asset dispositions, fundamental changes, restricted payments, and other customary covenants.Additionally, the Credit Agreement contains customary events of default and remedies for credit facilities of this nature. If the Company does not comply with the financial and other covenants in the Credit Agreement, the Lenders may, subject to customary cure rights, require immediate payment of all amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement and any outstanding unfunded commitments may be terminated.This summary of the Credit Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the full text of the Credit Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report and incorporated herein by reference.Guarantee and Security of the Exit Credit FacilityThe obligations under the Exit Credit Facility are guaranteed by the Company and the Guarantors (collectively, the “Loan Parties”) and secured by substantially all of the Loan Parties’ assets (subject to customary exceptions), including mortgages on not less than 90% of the PV-10 of proven reserves set forth on the reserve report and a guaranty and collateral agreement pursuant to which the Loan Parties granted a first lien security interest in all of the collateral described therein and the Guarantors guaranteed the payment and performance of all indebtedness and liabilities arising pursuant to, or in connection with, the Credit Agreement.Senior Unsecured Notes IndentureOn February 2, 2021, Chesapeake Escrow Issuer LLC (the “Escrow Issuer”) an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.500% senior notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) and $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.875% senior notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes” and, together with the 2026 Notes, the “Notes”).The offering of the Notes is part of a series of exit financing transactions being undertaken in connection with the Debtors’ Chapter 11 Cases and pursuant to the terms of the Plan as approved by the Bankruptcy Court on January 16, 2021.The Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of the Company’s subsidiaries that guarantee the Exit Credit Facility. The gross proceeds from the offering of the Notes were deposited into a segregated escrow account (the “Escrow Account”) and will be released upon satisfaction of certain escrow release conditions (the “Escrow Conditions”), including the occurrence of the Effective Date. Prior to the satisfaction of the Escrow Conditions, the Notes are secured by a lien on amounts deposited into the Escrow Account.If the Escrow Conditions are not met, the notes are subject to a special mandatory redemption at a special mandatory redemption price of 100% of the principal amount of such series of notes offered hereby, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the date of redemption. On the Effective Date, the Company assumed the Notes and the obligations of the Escrow Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture (as defined below). The term “Issuer” refers to (a) prior to the Effective Date, the Escrow Issuer, and (b) from and after the Effective Date, the Company.The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of February 5, 2021 (the “Indenture”), among the Issuer, the Guarantors and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee.Maturity and Interest Rate PaymentsThe 2026 Notes will mature on February 1, 2026.The 2029 Notes will mature on February 1, 2029.Interest on the Notes will be payable semi-annually, on February 1st and August 1st of each year, commencing on August 1, 2021, to holders of record on the immediately preceding January 15th and July 15th, as the case may be.RankingThe Notes are the Company’s senior unsecured obligations. Accordingly, they rank (i) equal in right of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness, including borrowings under the Exit Credit Facility, (ii) effectively subordinate in right of payment to all of existing and future secured indebtedness, including indebtedness under the Exit Credit Facility, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness, (iii) structurally subordinate in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of any future subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes and any entity that is not a subsidiary that does not guarantee the notes and (iv) senior in right of payment to all future subordinated indebtedness. Each guarantee of the notes by a guarantor is a general, unsecured, senior obligation of such guarantor. Accordingly, the guarantees (i) rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior indebtedness of such guarantor (including such guarantor’s guarantee of indebtedness under the Exit Credit Facility), (ii) are subordinated to all existing and future secured indebtedness of such guarantor, including such guarantor’s guarantee of indebtedness under our Exit Credit Facility, to the extent of the value of the collateral of such guarantor securing such secured indebtedness, (iii) are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of any future subsidiaries of such guarantor that do not guarantee the notes and (iv) rank senior in right of payment to all future subordinated indebtedness of such guarantor.CovenantsThe Indenture contains covenants limiting the Issuer’s and certain restricted subsidiaries’ ability to (i) incur additional debt and issue preferred stock, (ii) incur or create liens, (iii) pay dividends or distributions in respect of certain equity interests or redeem, repurchase or retire certain equity interests or subordinated indebtedness, (iv) make certain investments, (v) engage in specified sales of assets, (vi) enter into transactions with affiliates, (vii) engage in consolidation, mergers and acquisitions and (viii) create unrestricted subsidiaries. These covenants contain important exceptions, limitations and qualifications. At any time that the Notes are rated investment grade, certain covenants will be terminated and cease to apply.Optional RedemptionThe Issuer may redeem some or all of the 2026 Notes at any time prior to February 5, 2023 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes redeemed plus a “make-whole” premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. The Issuer may redeem some or all of the 2026 Notes at any time on or after February 5, 2023 at the redemption price set forth in the Indenture. In addition, at any time prior to February 5, 2023, up to 35% of the original aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes may be redeemed with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings, at the redemption price specified in the Indenture.The Issuer may redeem some or all of the 2029 Notes at any time prior to February 5, 2024 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2029 Notes redeemed plus a “make-whole” premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to the date of redemption. The Issuer may redeem some or all of the 2029 Notes at any time on or after February 5, 2024 at the redemption price set forth in the Indenture. In addition, at any time prior to February 5, 2024, up to 35% of the original aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes may be redeemed with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings, at the redemption price specified in the Indenture.Change of ControlUpon the occurrence of a change of control, the Issuer must offer to purchase the Notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to the date of repurchase.Events of DefaultThe Indenture also provides for customary events of default which, if certain of them occur: (i) would make all outstanding Notes due and payable immediately; or (ii) would allow the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes to declare the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable by notice in writing to the Issuer and, upon such declaration, such principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately.Registration Rights AgreementPursuant to the Plan, on the Effective Date, the Company entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) with certain stockholders (the “Holders”). The Registration Rights Agreement provides resale registration rights for the Holders’ Registrable Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement).Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company is required to file or confidentially submit a Resale Shelf Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) with respect to the Registrable Securities within 30 days of the Effective Date, or within 90 days of the Effective Date if “fresh start” accounting is required. The Company is required to maintain the effectiveness of any such registration statement until the Registrable Securities covered by the registration statement are no longer Registrable Securities or the Registrable Securities issued to the Holders may be sold in a single transaction without limitation under Rule 144. Additionally, the Holders have customary demand, underwritten offering and piggyback registration rights, subject to the limitations set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement.These registration rights are subject to certain conditions and limitations, including the right of underwriters to limit the number of shares to be included in a registration statement and the Company’s right to delay or withdraw a registration statement under certain circumstances. The Company will generally pay all registration expenses in connection with its obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement, regardless of whether a registration statement is filed or becomes effective. The registration rights granted in the Registration Rights Agreement are subject to customary indemnification and contribution provisions.The obligations to register the Registrable Securities under the Registration Rights Agreement will terminate with respect to the Company and each Holder on the first date upon which such Holder no longer owns any Registrable Securities.The description of the Registration Rights Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Registration Rights Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.2 to this Current Report and incorporated herein by reference.Warrant AgreementsOn the Effective Date and pursuant to the Plan, the Company entered into (i) a Warrant Agreement (the “Class A Warrant Agreement”) with Equiniti Trust Company, a New York limited trust company, as warrant agent (the “Warrant Agent”), which provides for the Company’s issuance of up to an aggregate of 11,111,111 Class A warrants (the “Class A Warrants”) to purchase the common stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per share, as reorganized pursuant to and under the Plan (the “New Common Stock”) to former holders of the Company’s Second Lien Notes (as defined below) on the Effective Date in accordance with the terms of the Plan, the Confirmation Order and the Class A Warrant Agreement, (ii) a Warrant Agreement (the “Class B Warrant Agreement”) with the Warrant Agent, which provides for the Company’s issuance of up to an aggregate of 12,345,679 Class B warrants (the “Class B Warrants”) to purchase New Common Stock to former holders of the Company’s Second Lien Notes on the Effective Date in accordance with the terms of the Plan, the Confirmation Order and the Class B Warrant Agreement and (iii) a Warrant Agreement (the “Class C Warrant Agreement” and, together with the Class A Warrant Agreement and the Class B Warrant Agreement, the “Warrant Agreements”) with the Warrant Agent, which provides for the Company’s issuance of up to an aggregate of 13,717,420 Class C warrants (the “Class C Warrants” and, together with the Class A Warrants and the Class B Warrants, the “Warrants”) to purchase New Common Stock to former holders of the Company’s Second Lien Notes and Unsecured Notes (as defined below) on the Effective Date in accordance with the terms of the Plan, the Confirmation Order and the Class C Warrant Agreement.The Warrants are exercisable from the date of issuance until the earlier of the 5th anniversary of the Effective Date and the consummation of a Liquidity Event (as defined in the Warrant Agreements), at which time all unexercised Warrants will expire, and the rights of the holders of such expired Warrants to purchase New Common Stock will terminate. The Class A Warrants are initially exercisable for one share of New Common Stock per Class A Warrant at an initial exercise price of $27.63 per Class A Warrant (the “Class A Exercise Price”), the Class B Warrants are initially exercisable for one share of New Common Stock per Class B Warrant at an initial exercise price of $32.13 per Class B Warrant (the “Class B Exercise Price”) and the Class C Warrants are initially exercisable for one share of New Common Stock per Class C Warrant at an initial exercise price of $36.18 per Class C Warrant (the “Class C Exercise Price” and, together with the Class A Exercise Price and Class B Exercise Price, the “Exercise Prices”), in each case subject to the cashless exercise provisions contained in the Warrant Agreements and subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.Pursuant to the Warrant Agreements, no holder of a Warrant, by virtue of holding or having a beneficial interest in a Warrant, will have the right to vote, receive dividends, receive notice as stockholders with respect to any meeting of stockholders for the election of the Company’s directors or any other matter, or exercise any rights whatsoever as a stockholder of the Company unless, until and only to the extent such holders become holders of record of shares of New Common Stock issued upon settlement of Warrants.The number of shares of New Common Stock for which a Warrant is exercisable, and the Exercise Prices, are subject to customary adjustments from time to time upon the occurrence of certain events, including: (1) stock splits, reverse stock splits or stock dividends to holders of New Common Stock or (2) a reclassification in respect of the New Common Stock.The foregoing description of the Warrant Agreements does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the full text of the Warrant Agreements, which are filed as Exhibits 10.3, 10.4 and 10.5 respectively, to this Current Report and incorporated by reference herein.Item 1.02.

Subject to the rights of any then-outstanding shares of preferred stock, the holders of New Common Stock may receive such dividends as the Board may declare in its discretion out of legally available funds. Holders of New Common Stock will be entitled to receive all of the remaining assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its shareholders, ratably in proportion to the number of shares of New Common Stock held by them. Preferred StockShares of preferred stock may be issued in one or more series from time to time, with each such series to consist of such number of shares and to have such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and such designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issuance of such series adopted by the Board and included in a certificate of designations (hereinafter referred to as the “Certificate of Designation”) filed pursuant to the Oklahoma General Corporation Act.Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of Incorporation, the number of authorized shares of preferred stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) to the extent permitted by the Oklahoma General Corporation Act and the Certificate of Designation.Anti-Takeover ProvisionsSome provisions of Oklahoma law, the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws summarized below could make certain change of control transactions more difficult, including acquisitions of the Company by means of a tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise, as well as removal of the incumbent directors. These provisions may have the effect of preventing changes in management. It is possible that these provisions would make it more difficult to accomplish or deter transactions that a stockholder might consider in his or her best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the New Common Stock.Number and Election of DirectorsThe Bylaws provide that the Board shall be comprised of no less than three and no more than ten directors, with the number of directors to be fixed from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board.Calling of Special Meeting of StockholdersThe Bylaws provide that special meetings of stockholders may be called only by (i) the chairman of the Board, (ii) the chief executive officer of the Company, (iii) the chief executive officer or the president of the Company, (iv) the Board acting pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the directors of the Board then in office or (v) the secretary of the Company upon the delivery of a written request to the Company by the holders of at least 35% of the voting power of the Company’s then outstanding capital stock in the manner provided in the Bylaws.Amendments to the BylawsSubject to certain restrictions set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws may be amended or repealed or new bylaws may be adopted (i) by action of the Board or (ii) without action of the Board, by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of New Common Stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.Other Limitations on Stockholder ActionsAdvance notice is required for stockholders to nominate directors or to submit proposals for consideration at meetings of stockholders. These procedures provide that notice of stockholder proposals must be timely given in writing to the corporate secretary prior to the meeting at which the action is to be taken. Generally, to be timely, notice must be received at the principal executive offices not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the anniversary of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders. The Bylaws specify in detail the requirements as to form and content of all stockholder notices. These requirements may preclude stockholders from bringing matters before the stockholders at an annual or special meeting. The Bylaws also describe certain criteria for when stockholder-requested meetings need not be held.Directors may be removed from office at any time by the affirmative vote of holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of New Common Stock entitled generally to vote in the election of directors.Newly Created Directorships and Vacancies on the BoardUnder the Bylaws, any newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the number of directors and any vacancies on the Board for any reason may be filled by a majority vote of the directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, and the directors so chosen shall hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier resignation or removal.Authorized but Unissued SharesThe Company’s authorized but unissued shares of New Common Stock are available for future issuance. The Company may use these additional shares of New Common Stock for a variety of corporate purposes, including future public offerings to raise additional capital, acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of New Common Stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of the Company by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise.Exclusive ForumThe Certificate of Incorporation provides that, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the state courts within the State of Oklahoma (or, if no such state court has jurisdiction, the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma) will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on the Company’s behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former directors, officers, other employees or stockholders to the Company or to the stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Oklahoma General Corporation Act, the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws (as each may be amended from time to time), or (iv) any action asserting a claim related to or involving the Company that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.The foregoing descriptions of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibits 3.1 and 3.2 and incorporated herein by reference.Elimination of Shareholders Rights PlanIn connection with the adoption of the Rights Agreement, on April 23, 2020, the Company filed a Certificate of Designations of Series B Preferred Stock with the Secretary of State of the State of Oklahoma setting forth the rights, powers, and preferences of the Series B Preferred Stock issuable upon exercise of the Rights (the “Preferred Shares”).

The Corporation agrees to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of the Independent Counsel referred to above and to fully indemnify such counsel against any and all Expenses, claims, liabilities and damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement or its engagement pursuant hereto.(h) The term “Proceeding” shall include any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, claim, counterclaim, cross claim, arbitration, mediation, alternate dispute resolution mechanism, investigation, inquiry, administrative hearing or any other actual, threatened or completed proceeding, whether brought in the right of the Corporation or otherwise and whether of a civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or investigative (formal or informal) nature, including any appeal therefrom, in which Indemnitee was, is or will be involved as a party, potential party, non-party witness or otherwise by reason of the fact that Indemnitee is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, by reason of any action taken by him (or a failure to take action by him) or of any action (or failure to act) on his part while acting pursuant to his Corporate Status, in each case whether or not serving in such capacity at the time any liability or Expense is incurred for which indemnification, reimbursement, or advancement of Expenses can be provided under this Agreement. If the Indemnitee believes in good faith that a given situation 3may lead to or culminate in the institution of a Proceeding, this shall be considered a Proceeding under this paragraph.(i) Reference to “other enterprise” shall include employee benefit plans; references to “fines” shall include any excise tax assessed with respect to any employee benefit plan; references to “serving at the request of the Corporation” shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in manner “not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation” as referred to in this Agreement.Section 3. Indemnity in Third-Party Proceedings. The Corporation shall indemnify Indemnitee in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3 if Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or a participant in any Proceeding, other than a Proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor. Pursuant to this Section 3, Indemnitee shall be indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against all Expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of such Expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on his behalf in connection with such Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein, if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and, in the case of a criminal Proceeding had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. The parties intend that this Agreement shall provide to the fullest extent permitted by law for indemnification in excess of that expressly permitted by statute, including, without limitation, any indemnification provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws, vote of its shareholders or disinterested directors or applicable law.Section 4. Indemnity in Proceedings by or in the Right of the Corporation. The Corporation shall indemnify Indemnitee in accordance with the provisions of this Section 4 if Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or a participant in any Proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor. Pursuant to this Section 4, Indemnitee shall be indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with such Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein, if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation. No indemnification for Expenses shall be made under this Section 4 in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which Indemnitee shall have been finally adjudged by a court to be liable to the Corporation, unless and only to the extent that any court in which the Proceeding was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification for such Expenses which the court shall deem proper.Section 5. Indemnification for Expenses of a Party Who is Wholly or Partly Successful. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and to the extent that Indemnitee is a party to (or a participant in) 4and is successful, on the merits or otherwise, in any Proceeding or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, in whole or in part, the Corporation shall indemnify Indemnitee against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith. If Indemnitee is not wholly successful in such Proceeding but is successful, on the merits or otherwise, as to one or more but less than all claims, issues or matters in such Proceeding, the Corporation shall indemnify Indemnitee against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with or related to each successfully resolved claim, issue or matter to the fullest extent permitted by law. For purposes of this Section and without limitation, the termination of any claim, issue or matter in such a Proceeding by dismissal, with or without prejudice, shall be deemed to be a successful result as to such claim, issue or matter.Section 6. Indemnification For Expenses of a Witness. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and to the extent that Indemnitee is, by reason of his Corporate Status, a witness or otherwise asked to participate in any Proceeding to which Indemnitee is not a party, he shall be indemnified against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection therewith.Section 7. Partial Indemnification. If Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Corporation for some or a portion of Expenses, but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the portion thereof to which Indemnitee is entitled.Section 8. Additional Indemnification.(a) Notwithstanding any limitation in Sections 3, 4, or 5, the Corporation shall indemnify Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law if Indemnitee is a party to or threatened to be made a party to any Proceeding (including a Proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor) against all Expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of such Expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection with the Proceeding.(b) For purposes of Section 8(a), the meaning of the phrase “to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law” shall include, but not be limited to:(i) to the fullest extent permitted by the provision of the Oklahoma Law that authorizes or contemplates additional indemnification by agreement, or the corresponding provision of any amendment to or replacement of the Oklahoma Law, and(ii) to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by any amendments to or replacements of the Oklahoma Law adopted after the date of this Agreement that increase the extent to which a corporation may indemnify its officers and directors.Section 9. Exclusions. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement, the Corporation shall not be obligated under this Agreement to make any indemnification payment in connection with any claim made against Indemnitee:5(a) for which payment has actually been made to or on behalf of Indemnitee under any insurance policy or other indemnity provision, except with respect to any excess beyond the amount paid under any insurance policy or other indemnity provision; or(b) for (i) an accounting of profits made from the purchase and sale (or sale and purchase) by Indemnitee of securities of the Corporation within the meaning of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act (as defined in Section 2(b) hereof) or similar provisions of state statutory law or common law, or (ii) any reimbursement of the Corporation by the Indemnitee of any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation or of any profits realized by the Indemnitee from the sale of securities of the Corporation, as required in each case under the Exchange Act (including any such reimbursements that arise from an accounting restatement of the Corporation pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), or the payment to the Corporation of profits arising from the purchase and sale by Indemnitee of securities in violation of Section 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act);(c) except as provided in Section 14(d) of this Agreement, in connection with any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) initiated by Indemnitee, including any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) initiated by Indemnitee against the Corporation or its directors, officers, employees or other indemnitees, unless (i) the Board authorized the Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) prior to its initiation or (ii) the Corporation provides the indemnification, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the Corporation under applicable law; or(d) in connection with any claim made against Indemnitee if the Corporation brings an action contesting the right of Indemnitee to receive indemnification or a payment hereunder and establishes that (i) Indemnitee intentionally misrepresented or failed to disclose a material fact in making the request for indemnification or payment or (ii) such indemnification or payment is prohibited by applicable law (such event, a “Disqualifying Event”); provided, however, that in any such action the Corporation shall have the burden of proving the occurrence of any such Disqualifying Event; provided, further, that the reduction in the obligation of the Corporation to make any payment under this clause (ii) shall only be to the extent that such obligation is prohibited by applicable law.Section 10. Advances of Expenses. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary (other than Section 14(d)), the Corporation shall advance, to the extent not prohibited by law, the Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) not initiated by Indemnitee, and such advancement shall be made within twenty (20) days after the receipt by the Corporation of a statement or statements requesting such advances from time to time, whether prior to or after final disposition of any Proceeding. Advances shall be unsecured and interest free. Advances shall be made without regard to Indemnitee’s ability to repay the Expenses and without regard to Indemnitee’s ultimate entitlement to indemnification under the other provisions of this Agreement. In accordance with Section 14(d), advances shall include any and all reasonable Expenses incurred pursuing an action to enforce this right of advancement, including Expenses incurred preparing and forwarding statements to the Corporation to support the advances claimed. The Indemnitee shall qualify for advances upon the execution and delivery to the Corporation of this Agreement, which shall constitute an undertaking providing that the Indemnitee undertakes to repay the amounts advanced (without interest) to the extent that it is ultimately determined that Indemnitee 6is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation. No other form of undertaking shall be required other than the execution of this Agreement. This Section 10 shall not apply to any claim made by Indemnitee for which indemnity is excluded pursuant to Section 9.Section 11. Procedure for Notification; Defense of Claim.(a) Indemnitee shall notify the Corporation in writing of any matter with respect to which Indemnitee intends to seek indemnification or advancement of Expenses hereunder as soon as reasonably practicable following the receipt by Indemnitee of written notice. The written notification to the Corporation shall include a description of the nature of the Proceeding and the facts underlying the Proceeding. To obtain indemnification under this Agreement, Indemnitee shall submit to the Corporation a written request, including such documentation and information as is reasonably available to Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification following the final disposition of such Proceeding. The omission by Indemnitee to notify the Corporation hereunder will not relieve the Corporation from any liability which it may have to Indemnitee under this Agreement or otherwise, and any delay in so notifying the Corporation shall not constitute a waiver by Indemnitee of any rights under this Agreement. The Secretary of the Corporation shall, promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification, advise the Board in writing that Indemnitee has requested indemnification.(b) The Corporation will be entitled to participate in the Proceeding at its own expense.(c) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, in the event the Corporation may be obligated to make any indemnity or payment in connection with a Proceeding, the Corporation shall be entitled to assume the defense of such Proceeding with counsel approved by Indemnitee, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, upon the delivery to Indemnitee of written notice of the Corporation’s election to do so. After delivery of such notice, approval of such counsel by Indemnitee and the retention of such counsel by the Corporation, the Corporation will not be liable to Indemnitee for any fees or expenses of counsel subsequently incurred by Indemnitee with respect to the same Proceeding. Notwithstanding the Corporation’s assumption of the defense of any such Proceeding, the Corporation shall be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of Indemnitee’s counsel to the extent (i) the employment of counsel by Indemnitee is authorized by the Corporation, (ii) counsel for the Corporation or Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there is a conflict of interest between the Corporation and Indemnitee in the conduct of any such defense such that Indemnitee needs to be separately represented, (iii) the Corporation is not financially or legally able to perform its indemnification obligations or (iv) the Corporation shall not have retained, or shall not continue to retain, such counsel to defend such Proceeding. The Corporation shall have the right to conduct such defense as it reasonably sees fit in its sole discretion. Regardless of any provision in this Agreement, Indemnitee shall have the right to employ counsel in any Proceeding at Indemnitee’s personal expense. The Corporation shall not be entitled, without the consent of Indemnitee, to assume the defense of any claim brought by or in the right of the Corporation. Indemnitee shall give the Corporation such information and cooperation in connection with the Proceeding as may be reasonably appropriate. The Corporation shall not be liable to indemnify Indemnitee for any settlement of any Proceeding (or any part thereof) effected without the Corporation’s prior 7written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, the Corporation shall have the right to settle any Proceeding (or any part thereof) without the consent of Indemnitee, provided, however, that the Corporation shall not settle any Proceeding (or any part thereof) in a manner that would impose any liability, penalty or admission of guilt or liability on Indemnitee without Indemnitee’s written consent.Section 12. Procedure Upon Application for Indemnification.(a) Upon written request by Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to Section 11(a), a determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to Indemnitee’s entitlement thereto shall be made in the specific case: (i) if a Change of Control shall have occurred, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee; or (ii) if a Change of Control shall not have occurred, (A) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum of the Board, (B) by a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum of the Board, (C) if there are no such Disinterested Directors or, if such Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee or (D) if so directed by the Board, by the shareholders of the Corporation; and, if it is so determined that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, payment to Indemnitee shall be made within ten (10) days after such determination. Indemnitee shall reasonably cooperate with the person, persons or entity making such determination with respect to Indemnitee’s entitlement to indemnification, including providing to such person, persons or entity upon reasonable advance request any documentation or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination. Any costs or Expenses (including attorneys’ fees and disbursements) incurred by Indemnitee in so cooperating with the person, persons or entity making such determination shall be borne by the Corporation (irrespective of the determination as to Indemnitee’s entitlement to indemnification) and the Corporation indemnifies and agrees to hold Indemnitee harmless from any such costs or Expenses. The Corporation promptly will advise Indemnitee in writing with respect to any determination that Indemnitee is or is not entitled to indemnification, including a description with specificity of any reason or basis for which indemnification has been denied.(b) In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 12(a) hereof, the Independent Counsel shall be selected as provided in this Section 12(b). If a Change of Control shall not have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Board, and the Corporation shall give written notice to Indemnitee advising him of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. If a Change of Control shall have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by Indemnitee (unless Indemnitee shall request that such selection be made by the Board, in which event the preceding sentence shall apply), and Indemnitee shall give written notice to the Corporation advising it of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. In either event, Indemnitee or the Corporation, as the case may be, may, within ten (10) days after such written notice of selection shall have been given, deliver to the Corporation or to Indemnitee, as the case may be, a written objection to such selection; provided, however, that such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel so selected does not meet the requirements of “Independent Counsel” as defined in Section 2 of this Agreement, and the objection shall set 8forth with particularity the factual basis of such assertion. Absent a proper and timely objection, the person so selected shall act as Independent Counsel. If such written objection is so made and substantiated, the Independent Counsel so selected may not serve as Independent Counsel unless and until such objection is withdrawn or a court has determined that such objection is without merit. If, within twenty (20) days after the later of submission by Indemnitee of a written request for indemnification pursuant to Section 11(a) hereof and the final disposition of the Proceeding, no Independent Counsel shall have been selected and not objected to, either the Corporation or Indemnitee may petition a court for resolution of any objection which shall have been made by the Corporation or Indemnitee to the other’s selection of Independent Counsel and/or for the appointment as Independent Counsel of a person selected by such court or by such other person as such court shall designate, and the person with respect to whom all objections are so resolved or the person so appointed shall act as Independent Counsel under Section 12(a) of this Agreement. Upon the due commencement of any judicial proceeding or arbitration pursuant to Section 14(a) of this Agreement, Independent Counsel shall be discharged and relieved of any further responsibility in such capacity (subject to the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing).Section 13. Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings.(a) In making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification under this Agreement, the person or persons or entity making such determination shall, to the fullest extent not prohibited by law, presume that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement if Indemnitee has submitted a request for indemnification in accordance with Section 11(a) of this Agreement, and the Corporation shall, to the fullest extent not prohibited by law, have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in connection with the making by any person, persons or entity of any determination contrary to that presumption. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including by its directors or Independent Counsel) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of any action pursuant to this Agreement that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including by its directors or Independent Counsel) that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct.(b) Subject to Section 14(e), if the person, persons or entity empowered or selected under Section 12 of this Agreement to determine whether Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification shall not have made a determination within sixty (60) days after receipt by the Corporation of the request therefor, the requisite determination of entitlement to indemnification shall, to the fullest extent not prohibited by law, be deemed to have been made and Indemnitee shall be entitled to such indemnification, absent (i) a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee’s statement not materially misleading, in connection with the request for indemnification, or (ii) a prohibition of such indemnification under applicable law; provided, however, that such 60-day period may be extended for a reasonable time, not to exceed an additional thirty (30) days, if the person, persons or entity making the determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification in good faith requires such additional time for the obtaining or evaluating of documentation and/or information relating thereto; and provided, further, that the foregoing provisions of this Section 913(b) shall not apply (i) if the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by the shareholders pursuant to Section 12(a) of this Agreement and if (A) within fifteen (15) days after receipt by the Corporation of the request for such determination the Board has resolved to submit such determination to the shareholders for their consideration at an annual meeting thereof to be held within seventy-five (75) days after such receipt and such determination is made thereat, or (B) a special meeting of shareholders is called within fifteen (15) days after such receipt for the purpose of making such determination, such meeting is held for such purpose within sixty (60) days after having been so called and such determination is made thereat, or (ii) if the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 12(a) of this Agreement.(c) The termination of any Proceeding or of any claim, issue or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not (except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement) of itself adversely affect the right of Indemnitee to indemnification or create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation or, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, that Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.(d) For purposes of any determination of good faith, Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in good faith if Indemnitee’s action is based on the records or books of account of the Enterprise, including financial statements, or on information supplied to Indemnitee by the directors or officers of the Enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to the Enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with the reasonable care by the Enterprise. The provisions of this Section 13(d) shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the other circumstances in which the Indemnitee may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this Agreement.(e) The knowledge and/or actions, or failure to act, of any director, officer, trustee, partner, managing member, fiduciary, agent or employee of the Enterprise shall not be imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right to indemnification under this Agreement.Section 14. Remedies of Indemnitee.(a) Subject to Section 14(e), in the event that (i) a determination is made pursuant to Section 12 of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, (ii) advancement of Expenses is not timely made pursuant to Section 10 of this Agreement, (iii) no determination of entitlement to indemnification shall have been made pursuant to Section 12(a) of this Agreement within ninety (90) days after receipt by the Corporation of the request for indemnification, (iv) payment of indemnification is not made pursuant to Section 5, 6 or 7 or the last sentence of Section 12(a) of this Agreement within ten (10) days after receipt by the Corporation of a written request therefor, (v) payment of indemnification pursuant to Section 3, 4 or 8 of this Agreement is not made within ten (10) days after a determination has been made that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, or (vi) in the event that the Corporation or any other person takes or threatens to take any action to declare this Agreement void or unenforceable, or institutes any litigation or other action or Proceeding 10designed to deny, or to recover from, the Indemnitee the benefits provided or intended to be provided to the Indemnitee hereunder, Indemnitee shall be entitled to an adjudication by a court of his entitlement to such indemnification or advancement of Expenses. Alternatively, Indemnitee, at his option, may seek an award in arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Indemnitee shall commence such proceeding seeking an adjudication or an award in arbitration within 180 days following the date on which Indemnitee first has the right to commence such proceeding pursuant to this Section 14(a); provided, however, that the foregoing clause shall not apply in respect of a proceeding brought by Indemnitee to enforce his rights under Section 5 of this Agreement. The Corporation shall not oppose Indemnitee’s right to seek any such adjudication or award in arbitration.(b) In the event that a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 12(a) of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 14 shall be conducted in all respects as a de novo trial, or arbitration, on the merits and Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of that adverse determination. In any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 14 the Corporation shall have the burden of proving Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses, as the case may be.(c) If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 12(a) of this Agreement that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Corporation shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 14, absent (i) a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee’s statement not materially misleading, in connection with the request for indemnification, or (ii) a prohibition of such indemnification under applicable law.(d) The Corporation shall, to the fullest extent not prohibited by law, be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 14 that the procedures and presumptions of this Agreement are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator that the Corporation is bound by all the provisions of this Agreement. It is the intent of the Corporation that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Indemnitee not be required to incur legal fees or other Expenses associated with the interpretation, enforcement or defense of Indemnitee’s rights under this Agreement by litigation or otherwise because the cost and expense thereof would substantially detract from the benefits intended to be extended to the Indemnitee hereunder. The Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify Indemnitee against any and all Expenses and, if requested by Indemnitee, shall (within ten (10) days after receipt by the Corporation of a written request therefor) advance, to the extent not prohibited by law, such Expenses to Indemnitee, which are incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any action brought by Indemnitee for indemnification or advance of Expenses from the Corporation under this Agreement or under any directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies maintained by the Corporation if, in the case of indemnification, Indemnitee is wholly successful on the underlying claims; if Indemnitee is not wholly successful on the underlying claims, then such indemnification shall be only to the extent Indemnitee is successful on such underlying claims or otherwise as permitted by law, whichever is greater.11(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no determination as to entitlement of Indemnitee to indemnification under this Agreement shall be required to be made prior to the final disposition of the Proceeding.Section 15. Non-exclusivity; Survival of Rights; Insurance; Subrogation.(a) The rights of indemnification and to receive advancement of Expenses as provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which Indemnitee may at any time be entitled under applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws, any agreement, a vote of shareholders or a resolution of directors, or otherwise. No amendment, alteration or repeal of this Agreement or of any provision hereof shall limit or restrict any right of Indemnitee under this Agreement in respect of any action taken or omitted by such Indemnitee in his Corporate Status prior to such amendment, alteration or repeal. To the extent that a change in Oklahoma Law, whether by statute or judicial decision, permits greater indemnification or advancement of Expenses than would be afforded currently under the Bylaws, Certificate of Incorporation and this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties hereto that Indemnitee shall enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by such change. No right or remedy herein conferred is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every other right and remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other right or remedy.(b) To the extent that the Corporation maintains an insurance policy or policies providing liability insurance for directors, officers, employees, or agents of the Enterprise, Indemnitee shall be covered by such policy or policies in accordance with its or their terms to the maximum extent of the coverage available for any such current or former director, officer, employee or agent under such policy or policies. If, at the time of the receipt of a notice of a claim pursuant to the terms hereof, the Corporation has director and officer liability insurance in effect, the Corporation shall give prompt notice of such claim or of the commencement of a Proceeding, as the case may be, to the insurers in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies. The Corporation shall thereafter take all necessary or desirable action to cause such insurers to pay, on behalf of the Indemnitee, all amounts payable as a result of such Proceeding in accordance with the terms of such policies.(c) In the event of any payment under this Agreement, the Corporation shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and take all action necessary to secure such rights, including execution of such documents as are necessary to enable the Corporation to bring suit to enforce such rights.(d) The Corporation shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment of amounts otherwise indemnifiable (or for which advancement is provided under this Agreement) under this Agreement if and to the extent that Indemnitee has otherwise actually received such payment under any insurance policy, contract, agreement or otherwise.12(e) The Corporation’s obligation to indemnify or advance Expenses under this Agreement to Indemnitee who is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, trustee, partner, managing member, fiduciary, employee or agent of any other corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise shall be reduced by any amount Indemnitee has actually received as indemnification or advancement of Expenses from such other corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise.(f) The Corporation hereby recognizes that Indemnitee may have certain rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided by one or more persons with whom or which such Indemnitee may be associated (a “Third-Party Indemnitor”), and the Corporation hereby acknowledges and agrees (i) that it is the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., its obligations to such persons are primary and any obligation of the Third-Party Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by such persons are secondary), (ii) that it shall be required to advance the full amount of expenses incurred by such persons and shall be liable for the full amount of all expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement to the extent legally permitted and required by the terms of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws or this Agreement (or any other agreement between the Corporation and such persons), without regard to any rights such persons may have against the Third-Party Indemnitors, and (iii) that it that it irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases the Third-Party Indemnitors from any and all claims against the Third-Party Indemnitors for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect thereof. The Corporation further agrees that no advancement or payment by the Third-Party Indemnitors on behalf of such persons with respect to any claim for which such persons have sought indemnification from the Corporation shall affect the foregoing and the Third-Party Indemnitors shall be subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment to all of the rights of recovery of such persons against the Corporation. The Corporation and each such person agree that the Third-Party Indemnitors are express third party beneficiaries of the terms of this Agreement. Section 16. Duration of Agreement. This Agreement shall continue until and terminate upon the later of: (a) ten (10) years after the date that Indemnitee shall have ceased to serve in any position of Corporate Status or (b) one (1) year after the final termination of any Proceeding then pending in respect of which Indemnitee is granted rights of indemnification or advancement of Expenses hereunder and of any proceeding commenced by Indemnitee pursuant to Section 14 of this Agreement relating thereto. The indemnification and advancement of expenses rights provided by or granted pursuant to this Agreement shall be binding upon and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns (including any direct or indirect successor by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Corporation), shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or of any other Enterprise, and shall inure to the benefit of Indemnitee and his or her spouse, assigns, heirs, devisees, executors and administrators and other legal representatives.Section 17. Severability. If any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement (including without limitation, each portion of any Section of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal 13or unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and shall remain enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law; (b) such provision or provisions shall be deemed reformed to the extent necessary to conform to applicable law and to give the maximum effect to the intent of the parties hereto; and (c) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, each portion of any Section of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested thereby.Section 18. Enforcement.(a) The Corporation expressly confirms and agrees that it has entered into this Agreement and assumed the obligations imposed on it hereby in order to induce Indemnitee to serve as a director or officer of the Corporation, and the Corporation acknowledges that Indemnitee is relying upon this Agreement in serving as a director or officer of the Corporation.(b) This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral, written and implied, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof; provided, however, that this Agreement is a supplement to and in furtherance of the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws and applicable law, and shall not be deemed a substitute therefor, nor to diminish or abrogate any rights of Indemnitee thereunder.(c) If a claim under this Agreement is not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty (60) days after a written claim, pursuant to Section 11(a), has been received by the Corporation, the Indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the Indemnitee has not met the standard of conduct which makes it permissible under the Oklahoma Law for the Corporation to indemnify the Indemnitee for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its board of directors, independent counsel or shareholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Oklahoma Law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its board of directors, independent counsel or shareholders) that the Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct. If a determination shall have been made pursuant to this paragraph (c) that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Corporation shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to this paragraph (c). The Corporation shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to this paragraph (c) that the procedures and presumptions of this Agreement are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in such proceeding that the Corporation is bound by all the provisions of this Agreement.14Section 19. Modification and Waiver. No supplement, modification or amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by the parties hereto. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provisions of this Agreement nor shall any waiver constitute a continuing waiver.Section 20. Notice by Indemnitee. Indemnitee agrees to notify the Corporation in writing as soon as reasonably practicable upon being served with any summons, citation, subpoena, complaint, indictment, information or other document relating to any Proceeding or matter which may be subject to indemnification or advancement of Expenses covered hereunder. The failure of Indemnitee to so notify the Corporation shall not relieve the Corporation of any obligation which it may have to the Indemnitee under this Agreement or otherwise.Section 21. Notices. All notices, requests, demands and other communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if (a) delivered by hand and receipted for by the party to whom said notice or other communication shall have been directed, (b) mailed by certified or registered mail with postage prepaid, on the third business day after the date on which it is so mailed, (c) mailed by reputable overnight courier and receipted for by the party to whom said notice or other communication shall have been directed or (d) sent by facsimile transmission, with receipt of written confirmation (email to suffice) that such transmission has been received:(a) If to Indemnitee, at the address indicated on the '],\n",

ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT. On March 27, 2020, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Inc. (the “Company”), Dick’s Merchandising & Supply Chain, Inc., and certain other subsidiaries of the Company entered into an amendment to the Company’s senior secured revolving credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, and the other lenders party thereto.The senior secured credit facility allows the Company, upon satisfaction of certain conditions, to request an increase to the aggregate commitments under the facility from $1.6 billion to $2.1 billion, subject to existing or new lenders agreeing to provide additional revolving commitments. The amendment increased the aggregate commitments under the senior secured credit facility by approximately $255 million, to approximately $1.855 billion. The availability of the commitments is subject to conditions and borrowing base limitations, which may fluctuate. The amendment also increased the applicable margins on base rate loans and LIBOR rate loans to the highest level under the existing pricing grid, 0.375% and 1.375%, respectively, until the Company elects to lower the aggregate commitments under the senior secured credit facility so that they no longer exceed $1.6 billion, and made other modifications, including introducing a LIBOR “floor” of 0.75% for purposes of calculating the interest rate on LIBOR based loans and modifying the borrowing base definition so that certain junior liens do not automatically disqualify eligible receivables and inventory from inclusion in the borrowing base. After giving effect to the amendment, the senior secured credit facility allows the Company, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, to request an increase of up to approximately $245 million in additional borrowing availability, subject to existing or new lenders agreeing to provide additional revolving commitments. The foregoing description of the amendment and the senior secured credit facility is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full and complete terms of the amendment which is included as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference and to the full and complete terms of the senior secured credit facility and its prior amendments, all of which were included as exhibits to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 20, 2020.ITEM 2.03.

The Company also provided a fourth quarter 2021 outlook.The information in Item 7.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference into any other filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.Full Year 2021 Outlook UpdateThe Company has raised its full year 2021 earnings per diluted share guidance to $13.70 to 13.79 compared to prior guidance of $12.88 to 13.06. In addition, the Company has raised its full year non-GAAP earnings per diluted share guidance to $15.50 to 15.60 compared to prior guidance of $14.60 to 14.80. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation is included in the table below under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures”. The Company also has raised its full year consolidated same store sales guidance and now expects consolidated same store sales to increase between 25.8% to 26.1%, compared to the previous guidance of between 24% to 25%. Fourth Quarter 2021 OutlookThe Company expects its fourth quarter 2021 earnings per diluted share will be $3.00 to 3.09. In addition, the Company expects its fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share will be $3.45 to 3.55. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation is included in the table below under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures”. The Company also anticipates that its fourth quarter 2021 consolidated same store sales will increase between 3.7% to 4.7%. Fiscal 2021 Consolidated Same Store Sales Consolidated same store sales include stores that were temporarily closed during fiscal 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The method of calculating consolidated same store sales varies across the retail industry, including the treatment of temporary store closures as a result of COVID-19. Accordingly, our method of calculating this metric may not be the same as other retailers’ methods. For additional information on consolidated same store sales, please see our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2021, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 24, 2021.Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to reporting the Company\\'s financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), the Company reports certain financial results that differ from what is reported under GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures include consolidated non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP income before income taxes, and non-GAAP diluted shares outstanding, which management believes provides investors with useful supplemental information to evaluate the Company’s ongoing operations and to compare with past and future periods. Management believes that excluding non-cash debt discount amortization from its convertible senior notes and including the share impact from the convertible note hedge is useful to investors because it provides a more complete view of the economics of the transaction. Management also uses certain non-GAAP measures internally for forecasting, budgeting, and measuring its operating performance. These measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the Company\\'s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The methods used by the Company to calculate its non-GAAP financial measures may differ significantly from methods used by other companies to compute similar measures. As a result, any non-GAAP financial measures presented herein may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies.

REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE The Company is furnishing the following information:Beginning in fiscal 2022, the Company is revising its method for determining its comparable store sales calculations. Comparable store sales measures the growth in sales for a store location for a particular period from the corresponding period in the prior year and includes both brick and mortar and eCommerce sales. Prior to fiscal 2022, relocated store locations were excluded from comparable store sales calculations until the relocated store commenced its 14th full month of operations.

The Company does not view relocations as store closures and believes its revised calculation is consistent with this view. The table being furnished and included herewith as Exhibit 99.2 presents quarterly and full year comparable store sales results for fiscal 2021 calculated in the same manner as comparable store sales will be calculated beginning in fiscal 2022. The table will be made available on the investor relations section of the Company's website at www.dickssportinggoods.com/investors and such figures will be reflected as the Company's historical comparable store sales results in the future.

In connection with any action being taken in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction, for purposes of determining compliance with any provision of this Agreement which requires that any of the representations and warranties made by any Loan Party set forth in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document be true and correct, such condition shall be deemed satisfied, so long as (x) the representations and warranties in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are true and correct in all material respects (without duplication of any materiality qualifier therein) as of (A) in the case of a Limited Condition Acquisition the date of execution of the definitive agreement(s) for such Limited Condition Transaction and (B) in all other cases, the date of the applicable declaration, irrevocable advance notice or irrevocable offer and (y) in the case of a Limited Condition Acquisition, customary “specified representations” and “specified acquisition agreement representations” are true and correct in all material respects (without duplication of any materiality qualifier therein), at the time of, and immediately after giving effect to, the consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, and neither the Borrower nor any other Loan Party shall be required to bring down any other representation or warranty as a condition to the consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction (or the incurrence of any Indebtedness and any other ancillary transaction consummated in connection with such Limited Condition Transaction).(b) In connection with any action being taken in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction, for purposes of:(i) determining compliance with any provision of this Agreement which requires pro forma compliance with the financial covenants set forth in Section 6.01 or calculation of the Leverage Ratio or Senior Secured Leverage Ratio; or(ii) testing baskets set forth in this Agreement (including provisions measured as a percentage of Consolidated Total Assets);in each case, at the option of the Borrower (the Borrower’s election to exercise such option in connection with any Limited Condition Transaction, an “LCT Election”), the date of determination of whether any such action is permitted hereunder, shall be deemed to be (A) in the case of a Limited Condition Acquisition, the date the definitive agreements for such Limited Condition Transaction are entered into and (B) in all other cases, the date of the applicable declaration, irrevocable advance notice or irrevocable offer (such date, the “LCT Test Date”), and if, after giving pro forma effect to the Limited Condition Transaction and the other transactions to 41be entered into in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they had occurred at the beginning of the applicable Test Period, the Borrower could have taken such action on the relevant LCT Test Date in compliance with such ratio or basket, such ratio or basket shall be deemed to have been complied with. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Borrower has made an LCT Election and any of the ratios or baskets for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date are exceeded as a result of fluctuations after such LCT Test Date in any such ratio or basket, including due to fluctuations after such LCT Test Date in Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA of the Borrower or the Person subject to such Limited Condition Transaction or any applicable currency exchange rate, at or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction or action, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations. If the Borrower has made an LCT Election for any Limited Condition Transaction, then in connection with any subsequent calculation of any ratio or basket availability with respect to the incurrence of Indebtedness or Liens, or the making of Investments, Restricted Payments, Asset Sales, fundamental changes under Section 6.05 or the designation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary on or following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or, (A) in the case of a Limited Condition Acquisition, the definitive agreement for such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated expires without consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction or (B) in all other cases, the Limited Condition Transaction is terminated without consummation, any such ratio or basket (other than for purposes of determining compliance with the financial covenants set forth in Section 6.01 as of the end of any fiscal quarter) shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming such Limited Condition Transaction and other transactions in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) have been consummated.(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, any Lender may exchange, continue or roll over all or a portion of its Loans in connection with any refinancing, extension, loan modification or similar transaction permitted by the terms of this Agreement, pursuant to a cashless settlement mechanism approved by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and such Lender.SECTION 1.07 Divisions.

In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of each Issuing Bank, such Revolving Lender’s Applicable Aggregate Revolving Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date due as provided in clause (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. Each Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this subparagraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Revolving Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in clause (d)(i) above or in clause (e) below, in the event that on the Maturity Date for Revolving Loans any Letter of Credit shall be a Cash Collateralized Letter of Credit, then the Revolving Lenders shall be deemed to have no participations in, and no obligations with respect to, such Letter of 46Credit except to the extent of the LC Disbursements made thereunder on or prior to the date that is five Business Days prior to such Maturity Date.(e) Reimbursement. (i) If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on (A) the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice of such LC Disbursement, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on any Business Day, or (B) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives notice of such LC Disbursement, if such notice is not received prior to such time on any Business Day or is received on a day that is not a Business Day; provided that, unless the Borrower shall have notified the Administrative Agent and the applicable Issuing Bank prior to 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on (A) the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice of such LC Disbursement, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on any Business Day, or (B) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives notice of such LC Disbursement, if such notice is not received prior to such time on any Business Day or is received on a day that is not a Business Day, the Borrower shall be deemed to have given a timely Borrowing Request to the Administrative Agent requesting Revolving Lenders make Revolving Loans that are ABR Loans on such date in an amount in dollars equal to such LC Disbursement, subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Revolving Commitments and satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 4.02.(ii) If the Borrower fails to make any payment described in clause (i) above with respect to a Letter of Credit, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Revolving Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Revolving Lender’s Applicable Aggregate Revolving Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice and in no event later than one Business Day following receipt of such notice, each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Aggregate Revolving Percentage of the payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Revolving Loans made by the Revolving Lenders to the Borrower (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Revolving Lenders pursuant to this subparagraph), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the applicable Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders.

Any payment made by a Revolving Lender pursuant to this subparagraph to reimburse an Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower (or any other account party in respect of the relevant Letter of Credit) of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.(f) Obligations Absolute. The Borrower’s obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in clause (e) above shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by an Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower’s obligations hereunder. None of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders or the Issuing Banks, or any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in 47connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of an Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse any Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Bank’s failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, an Issuing Bank may replace a purportedly lost, stolen, or destroyed original Letter of Credit or missing amendment thereto with a replacement marked as such or waive a requirement for its presentation, and with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.(g) Disbursement Procedures. An Issuing Bank for any Letter of Credit shall, within the time allowed by applicable laws or the specific terms of the Letter of Credit following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit issued by it. Such Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.(h) Interim Interest. If an Issuing Bank for any Letter of Credit shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse or refinance such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at a rate per annum (computed in accordance with Section 2.13(e)) equal to the rate then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans; provided that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to clause (e) of this Section, then Section 2.13(d) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Revolving Lender pursuant to clause (e) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment (it being agreed that the rate at which such interest shall be deemed to accrue for the account of the Revolving Lenders shall correspond to the rate at which, pursuant to the next preceding sentence, interest accrues on the portion of the applicable unreimbursed LC Disbursement equal to the product of (x) the amount of such LC Disbursement and (y) the sum of the Applicable Aggregate Revolving Percentages of all the Revolving Lenders).(i) Termination of an Issuing Bank. Any Issuing Bank may cease to be an Issuing Bank at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and such Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Revolving Lenders of any such termination of an Issuing Bank. At the time any such termination shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the terminated Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.12. After the termination of an Issuing Bank hereunder, such Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing 48Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such termination, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.(j) Additional Issuing Banks; Issuing Banks for Existing Letters of Credit. The Borrower may, at any time and from time to time, with the consent of the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) and the designated Lender, designate one or more additional Lenders to act as an Issuing Bank under the terms of this Agreement, and any Lender so designated shall become an Issuing Bank hereunder. Each Lender identified as an issuer of any of the Existing Letters of Credit identified on Schedule 2.05 shall be an Issuing Bank hereunder with respect to each Existing Letter of Credit issued by such Lender; provided, however, that unless such Lender is Barclays Bank or a Lender designated as an Issuing Bank in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, such Lender shall have no obligation to issue any additional Letters of Credit (or to amend, renew or extend any Existing Letter of Credit) pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.(k) Issuing Bank Reports. Unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank shall report in writing to the Administrative Agent (i) on or prior to each Business Day on which such Issuing Bank issues, amends, renews or extends any Letter of Credit, the date of such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, and the aggregate face amount of the Letters of Credit issued, amended, renewed or extended by it and outstanding after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (and whether the amount thereof shall have changed), (ii) on each Business Day on which such Issuing Bank makes any LC Disbursement, the date and amount of such LC Disbursement, (iii) on any Business Day on which the Borrower fails to reimburse an LC Disbursement required to be reimbursed to such Issuing Bank on such day, the date of such failure and the amount of such LC Disbursement and (iv) on any other Business Day, such other information as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request as to the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank and outstanding on such Business Day.(l) Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of any Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposures representing more than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrower shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in clause (g) or (h) of Section 7.01. The Borrower also shall deposit cash collateral in accordance with this paragraph as and to the extent required by Section 2.11. Each such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the Obligations under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Borrower’s risk and expense (provided that such cash collateral shall be invested solely in investments that provide for preservation of capital), such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Banks for LC Disbursements for which they have not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposures representing more than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. If the Borrower is required to deposit cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower (i) within 3 Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived or (ii) immediately after the payment and performance in 49full of all Obligations hereunder (other than contingent indemnification obligations not yet due and payable and obligations under Swap Agreements not yet due and payable) and the termination of this Agreement.(m) Rights of Issuing Bank. Each Issuing Bank shall, to the extent applicable, have all of the benefits and immunities provided to the Administrative Agent under this Agreement with respect to any actions taken or not taken by such Issuing Bank in connection with Letters of Credit.SECTION 2.06 Funding of Borrowings. (a) Subject to Section 2.03, each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, New York City time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the applicable Lenders. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account as provided in writing by the Borrower; provided that ABR Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank.(b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with clause (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the applicable Borrowing. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such Borrowing.SECTION 2.07 Interest Elections. (a)  Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a SOFR Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert any such Borrowing (or any part thereof) to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a SOFR Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.(b) Notice of Elections. Each such election pursuant to this Section shall be made upon the Borrower’s irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent. Each such notice shall be in the form of a written Interest Election Request, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower and must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election.(c) Each Interest Election Request shall specify the following information:50(i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);(ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;(iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a SOFR Borrowing; and(iv) if the resulting Borrowing is to be a SOFR Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term “Interest Period”.If any such Interest Election Request requests a SOFR Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one (1) month’s duration.(d) Notice by Administrative Agent to Lenders. Promptly, and in no event later than one Business Day, following receipt of an Interest Election Request the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender’s portion of each resulting Borrowing.(e) Failure to Elect; Events of Default. If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a SOFR Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a SOFR Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each SOFR Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.SECTION 2.08 Termination and Reduction of Commitments. (a) Unless previously terminated, the Commitments for a Class of Loans will terminate on the Maturity Date for such Class of Loans.(b) The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments; provided that (i) each reduction of the Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000 and (ii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Revolving Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of Revolving Loans, the total Revolving Exposure would exceed the total Revolving Commitments.(c) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce any Commitments under clause (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, by delivering a Commitment Termination Notice to the Administrative Agent. Promptly and in no event later than one Business Day following receipt of any Commitment Termination Notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Revolving Lenders and each Issuing Bank of the contents thereof. Each Commitment Termination Notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; provided that a Commitment Termination Notice delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or the closing of other transactions, in which case such Commitment Termination Notice may be revoked by the 51Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments of any Class shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments of any Class shall be made ratably among the Lenders of such Class in accordance with their respective Commitments of such Class.SECTION 2.09 Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt. (a) The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Revolving Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan on the Maturity Date for Revolving Loans, (ii) to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lender of any Class of Incremental Term Loans the then unpaid principal amount of each Incremental Term Loan of such Class as provided in the applicable Incremental Term Loan Amendment and (iii) to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender and any applicable Revolving Lenders, all Swingline Loans and all other amounts owed hereunder with respect to the Swingline Loans on the earlier of (x) the date which is 10 Business Days after the incurrence thereof and (y) the date of termination of the Revolving Commitments.(b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.(c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class, if applicable, and Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender’s share thereof.(d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to clause (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.(e) Any Lender may request that Loans of any Class made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).SECTION 2.10 [Intentionally Omitted].SECTION 2.11 Prepayment of Loans; Cash Collateralization of Letters of Credit. (a)  The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to the requirements of this Section and payment of any amounts required under Section 2.16; provided, that each such partial repayment shall be in an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000.(b) In the event and on each occasion that the aggregate Revolving Exposure exceeds the aggregate Revolving Commitments, the Borrower shall promptly prepay Revolving Borrowings in an aggregate amount equal to such excess.52(c) [Intentionally Omitted].(d) [Intentionally Omitted].(e) In connection with any prepayment or cash collateralization of Letters of Credit hereunder, the Borrower shall deliver the Administrative Agent a Prepayment Notice (i) in the case of a prepayment of a SOFR Borrowing, not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment or (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Borrowing or cash collateralization of a Letter of Credit, not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, one Business Day before the date of prepayment or cash collateralization. Each Prepayment Notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment or cash collateralization date, the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid and, in the case of a mandatory prepayment or cash collateralization, a reasonably detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment or cash collateralization; provided, that a Prepayment Notice may state that such Prepayment Notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, indentures or similar agreements or other transactions, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Promptly following receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the applicable Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02, except as necessary to apply fully the required amount of a mandatory prepayment. Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.13.SECTION 2.12 Fees. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender a commitment fee, which shall accrue at the Applicable Commitment Fee Rate, on the daily unused amount of the Revolving Commitment of such Revolving Lender during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the date on which the Revolving Commitments terminate; provided, that (i) any commitment fee accrued with respect to any of the Revolving Commitments of a Defaulting Lender during the period prior to the time such Lender became a Defaulting Lender and unpaid at such time shall be payable by the Borrower so long as such commitment fee shall otherwise have been due and payable by the Borrower prior to such time of such Lender becoming a Defaulting Lender and (ii) no commitment fee shall accrue on any of the Revolving Commitments of a Defaulting Lender so long as such Lender shall be a Defaulting Lender. Accrued commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on the last Business Day of March, June, September and December of each year and on the date on which the last of the Revolving Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date. All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). For purposes of computing commitment fees, a Revolving Commitment of a Revolving Lender shall be deemed to be used to the extent of the outstanding Revolving Loans of such Lender and the portion of the LC Exposure of such Lender attributable to such its Revolving Commitment (and the Swingline Exposure of such Lender shall be disregarded for such purpose).(b) The Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender a participation fee with respect to the portion of the LC Exposure of such Lender attributable to its Revolving Commitment, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate used to determine the interest rate applicable to SOFR Revolving Loans on the average daily amount of such portion of the LC Exposure of such Lender attributable to its Revolving Commitment (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lender’s Revolving Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure and (ii) to each Issuing Bank a fronting fee, which shall accrue at the rate of 0.125% per annum on the average daily amount of the portion of the LC Exposure attributable to Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank (excluding any portion thereof attributable to 53unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date of termination of the LC Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well as each Issuing Bank’s standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and December of each year shall be payable on the last Business Day of March, June, September and December of each year, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date; provided that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the LC Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the LC Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other fees payable to any Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within 10 days after demand. All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).(c) In addition to any of the foregoing fees, the Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent such other fees (including administrative agency fees) payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.(d) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to each Issuing Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of commitment fees and participation fees, to the Lenders. Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.SECTION 2.13 Interest. (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate.(b) The Loans comprising each SOFR Borrowing shall bear interest at Adjusted Term SOFR for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate.(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any LC Disbursement or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall, at the election of the Required Lenders while any Specified Event of Default exists (or automatically while any Event of Default under Section 7.01(g) or 7.01(h) exists), bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2.00% per annum plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section, (ii) in the case of overdue unreimbursed amounts with respect to any LC Disbursement, 2.00% per annum plus the rate otherwise applicable to such LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05 or (iii) in the case of any other amount, 2.00% per annum plus the highest rate applicable to ABR Revolving Loans as provided in clause (a) of this Section.(d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and, in the case of Revolving Loans, upon termination of the Revolving Commitments; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to clause (c) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the applicable Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any SOFR Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.(e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 54days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate or Adjusted Term SOFR shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.SECTION 2.14 Changed Circumstance. (a) Circumstances Affecting Benchmark Availability. Subject to clause (c) below, in connection with any request for a SOFR Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof or otherwise, if for any reason (i) the Administrative Agent shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that reasonable and adequate means do not exist for ascertaining Adjusted Term SOFR for the applicable Interest Period with respect to a proposed SOFR Loan on or prior to the first day of such Interest Period or (ii) the Required Lenders shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that Adjusted Term SOFR does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining such Loans during such Interest Period and, in the case of clause (ii), the Required Lenders have provided notice of such determination to the Administrative Agent, then, in each case, the Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Borrower. Upon notice thereof by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower, any obligation of the Lenders to make SOFR Loans, and any right of the Borrower to convert any Loan to or continue any Loan as a SOFR Loan, shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected SOFR Loans or the affected Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent (with respect to clause (ii), at the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, (A) the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of SOFR Loans (to the extent of the affected SOFR Loans or the affected Interest Periods) or, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a borrowing of or conversion to ABR Loans in the amount specified therein and (B) any outstanding affected SOFR Loans will be deemed to have been converted into ABR Loans at the end of the applicable Interest Period. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 2.16. (b) Laws Affecting SOFR Availability. If, after the date hereof, any Change in Law or any change in the interpretation or application thereof by any central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or application thereof shall make it unlawful or impossible for any of the Lenders (or any of their respective lending offices) to honor its obligations hereunder to make or maintain any SOFR Loan, or to determine or charge interest based upon SOFR, the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Adjusted Term SOFR or Term SOFR, such Lender shall promptly give notice thereof to the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice to the Borrower and the other Lenders (an “Illegality Notice”). Thereafter, until each affected Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist, (i) any obligation of the Lenders to make SOFR Loans, and any right of the Borrower to convert any Loan to a SOFR Loan or continue any Loan as a SOFR Loan, shall be suspended and (ii) if necessary to avoid such illegality, the Administrative Agent shall compute the ABR without reference to clause (c) of the definition of “ABR”. Upon receipt of an Illegality Notice, the Borrower shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, upon demand from any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all SOFR Loans to ABR Loans (and, in each case, if necessary to avoid such illegality, the Administrative Agent shall compute the ABR without reference to clause (c) of the definition of “ABR”), on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if all affected Lenders may lawfully continue to maintain such SOFR Loans to such day, or immediately, if any Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such SOFR Loans to such day. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall 55also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 2.16. (c) Benchmark Replacement Setting.  (i) Benchmark Replacement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document (and any derivative transaction shall be deemed not to be a “Loan Document” for purposes of this Section 2.14), if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-current Benchmark, then (i) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (1) of the definition of “Benchmark Replacement” for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document and (ii) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (2) of the definition of “Benchmark Replacement” for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day after the date on which notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders of any outstanding Class. (ii) Conforming Changes. In connection with the use, administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes, in consultation with the Borrower, from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document. (iii) Notices; Standards for Decisions and Determinations. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of (A) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement and (B) the effectiveness of any Conforming Changes in connection with the use, administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower of the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to Section 2.14(c)(iv). Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 2.14(c), including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 2.14(c). (iv) Unavailability of Tenor of Benchmark. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (A) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including the Term SOFR Reference Rate) and either (1) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (2) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is not or will not be representative, 56then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of “Interest Period” (or any similar or analogous definition) for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (B) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (A) above either (1) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (2) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is not or will not be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of “Interest Period” (or any similar or analogous definition) for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor. (v) Benchmark Unavailability Period. Upon the Borrower’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, (A) the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of SOFR Loans to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a borrowing of or conversion to ABR Loans and (B) any outstanding affected SOFR Loans will be deemed to have been converted to ABR Loans at the end of the applicable Interest Period. During any Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of the ABR based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of the ABR.SECTION 2.15 Increased Costs. (a)  Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall:(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender or Issuing Bank; or(ii) impose on any Lender or Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or SOFR Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any SOFR Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then, after receipt of the certificate provided by such Lender or Issuing Bank pursuant to clause (c) of this Section 2.15, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered in the amount set forth in the certificate of such Lender delivered pursuant to clause (c) below; provided, that Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any such compensation unless the Lender or other Person requesting such compensation is also requesting compensation as a result of such Change in Law from other similarly situated customers under agreements relating to similar credit transactions that include provisions similar to this Section 2.15(a).(b) Capital Requirements. If any Lender or Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or Issuing Bank’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s or Issuing Bank’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or Issuing Bank or such Lender’s or Issuing Bank’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into 57consideration such Lender’s or Issuing Bank’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s or Issuing Bank’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then, after receipt of the certificate provided by such Lender or Issuing Bank pursuant to clause (c) of this Section 2.15, from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or such Lender’s or Issuing Bank’s holding company for any such reduction suffered; provided, that Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any such compensation unless the Lender or other Person requesting such compensation is also requesting compensation as a result of such Change in Law from other similarly situated customers under agreements relating to similar credit transactions that include provisions similar to this Section 2.15(b).(c) Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender or Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in clause (a) or (b) of this Section delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.(d) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s or Issuing Bank’s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than 6 months prior to the date that such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s or Issuing Bank’s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided, further, that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 6 month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.SECTION 2.16 Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any SOFR Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any SOFR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any SOFR Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.11(e) and is revoked in accordance therewith), or (d) the assignment of any SOFR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event (excluding loss of anticipated profits). A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section (together with accompanying reasonably detailed calculations and accompanying backup evidence) delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Absent manifest error, the Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.SECTION 2.17 Taxes. (a)  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if the Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes (including Other Taxes) from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall withhold or deduct an amount equal to such Taxes and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.58(b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.(c) Without limiting or duplicating the provisions of clause (a) above, the Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and each Issuing Bank, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto (other than those resulting from such Person’s gross negligence or willful misconduct), whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability and setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation and basis for such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or an Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or an Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.(d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.(e) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in clauses (f) and (g) of this Section) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.(f) Any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or about the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax.(g) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower and on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), including the following, if applicable and, in all cases, only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so: (i) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN-E or W-8BEN, as applicable, claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party, (ii) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI, (iii) in the case of a Foreign 59Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (A) a certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (1) a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (2) a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code or (3) a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (B) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN-E or W-8BEN, as applicable, or (iv) any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States federal withholding tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law, as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate.(h) If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay over such refund to the Borrower of such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, but in each case only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund, net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided, that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this clause (h), in no event will the Administrative Agent or a Lender be required to pay any amount to the Borrower pursuant to this clause (h) to the extent the payment of which would place the Administrative Agent or a Lender in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the Administrative Agent or a Lender would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.(i) If any Governmental Authority shall determine that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold any Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender or any of its Related Parties (each a “Recipient”) (whether because such Recipient failed to deliver or to complete properly any form or to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstances that affected its exemption from withholding or for any other reason), such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as a result of such determination, including any penalties or interest assessed by such Governmental Authority, and including Taxes imposed on amounts payable to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph, together with all reasonable costs and expenses related thereto.(j) If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to United States withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for the purposes of this paragraph, FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.60SECTION 2.18 Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Setoffs. (a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder or under any other Loan Document prior to the time expressly required hereunder or under such other Loan Document for such payment (or, if no such time is expressly required, prior to 1:00 p.m., New York City time), on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without setoff or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 745 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York, except payments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank as expressly provided herein shall be so made and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in dollars.(b) Application of Insufficient Payments. If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.(c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and participations in LC Disbursements of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and participations in LC Disbursements; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or any Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally 61agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.(e) Deductions by Administrative Agent. If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(d) or 2.05(e), 2.06(b) or 2.18(d), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender’s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.(f) In the event that any financial statement or certificate delivered pursuant to Section 5.01 shall prove to have been inaccurate (regardless of whether the Commitments are in effect or any Loans or Letters of Credit are outstanding when such inaccuracy is discovered), and such inaccuracy shall have resulted in the payment of any interest or fees at rates lower than those that were in fact applicable for any period (based on the Borrower’s actual Leverage Ratio), then the Borrower shall promptly deliver to the Administrative Agent a corrected financial statement or certificate, as the case may be, and pay to the Administrative Agent, for distribution to the Lenders (or former Lenders) as their interests may appear, the accrued interest or fees that should have been paid but were not paid as a result of the inaccuracy of such financial statement or certificate (it being understood that nothing in this sentence shall limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders under Section 2.13(c) or Section 7.01).SECTION 2.19 Mitigation Obligations. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable and documented costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.SECTION 2.20 Additional Loans and Commitments. (a) The Borrower, the Administrative Agent and one or more Lenders or other financial institutions may on one or more occasions, and without the consent of any other Lender, amend this Agreement to provide for (i) new Incremental Term Loans of such Lenders or other financial institutions of one or more additional Classes or (ii) an increase to the existing Revolving Commitments (any Lender or other financial institution making a new Incremental Term Loan or extending a new Term Commitment or Revolving Commitment pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above being called an “Incremental Lender”); provided that (A) in the case of any Incremental Term Loans established or any Additional Revolving Commitments established pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii) above, the aggregate principal amount thereof shall not exceed the Permitted Incremental Amount at such time plus Incremental Term Loans and Additional Revolving Commitments so long as after giving effect thereto on a pro forma basis (assuming for purposes thereof that any Term Commitments and such Additional Revolving Commitments have been fully drawn), the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be in compliance with a Senior Secured Leverage Ratio of not greater than 3.50:1.00, (B) each Incremental Lender, if not already a Lender hereunder, shall be reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, and, in the case of an Incremental Lender establishing an Additional Revolving Commitment, each Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender, (C) no Lender shall be required to participate in the Incremental Term Loans or the Additional Revolving Commitments and (D) the aggregate principal amount of the new Incremental Term Loans being established or the Additional Revolving Commitments being established on any one occasion pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) 62above shall be an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $25,000,000 (or shall equal the maximum amount of new Incremental Term Loans or Additional Revolving Commitments, as the case may be, at the time permitted to be made or established under clause (A) of this proviso).(b) In connection with any new Class of Incremental Term Loans established pursuant to clause (a)(i) of this Section, the Borrower, each Incremental Lender providing such Class of Incremental Term Loans and the Administrative Agent shall execute and deliver an amendment agreement (an “Incremental Term Loan Amendment”) setting forth, to the extent applicable, the following terms of such Incremental Term Loans: (i) the designation of such Class, which shall be specified by the Borrower, (ii) the maturity or termination date applicable to the Incremental Term Loans or Commitments of such Class, (iii) any amortization applicable to the Incremental Term Loans of such Class (which shall not exceed 5.0% per annum) , (iv) the interest rate or rates applicable to the Incremental Term Loans of such Class (and, if applicable, any “most favored nation” requirements with respect to interest rate), (v) the fees applicable to the Incremental Term Loans or Commitments of such Class, (vi) any original issue discount applicable to Incremental Term Loans or Commitments of such Class, (vii) the initial Interest Period or Interest Periods applicable to Incremental Term Loans or Commitments of such Class and (viii) any voluntary or mandatory prepayment requirements or Commitment reductions applicable to Incremental Term Loans or Commitments of such Class (which, to the extent applicable, shall be consistent with Sections 2.08(b), 2.11(a) and 2.11(e)) and any restrictions on the voluntary or mandatory prepayment or reduction of Incremental Term Loans or Commitments of Classes established after such Class, and implementing such additional amendments to this Agreement as shall be appropriate, in the judgment of the Administrative Agent, to give effect to the foregoing terms and to provide the rights and benefits of this Agreement and other Loan Documents to the Incremental Term Loans of such Class, and such amendment will be effective to amend this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on the terms set forth therein without the consent of any other Lender, any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender. Except as contemplated by the preceding sentence, the terms of each new Class of Incremental Term Loans established under this Section shall (i) if the initial issuance of Incremental Term Loans hereunder, be consistent with then current market terms and (ii) otherwise be the same as those of the Term Loans existing at the time such new Class is established (other than such terms that are included in this Agreement for the benefit of the existing Lenders or that are only in effect after the applicable maturity date thereof). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) except as provided in clauses (i) through (viii) above, no Incremental Term Loan Amendment shall alter the rights of any Lender (other than the Incremental Lenders) in a manner that would not be permitted under Section 9.02 without the consent of such Lender unless such consent shall have been obtained, and (ii) no Incremental Term Loans shall (A) have a Maturity Date earlier than the Maturity Date of the Revolving Loans or an outstanding Class of Term Loans without the prior written consent of Lenders holding a majority of the principal amount of the Revolving Loans or Term Loans of such Class, as applicable or (B) have an average life to maturity shorter than the average life to maturity of an outstanding Class of Term Loans without the prior written consent of Lenders holding a majority of the principal amount of the Loans of such Class.(c) In connection with any establishment of Additional Revolving Commitments pursuant to clause (a)(ii) of this Section, the Borrower, each Incremental Lender providing such Additional Revolving Commitments and the Administrative Agent shall execute and deliver an agreement (an “Additional Revolving Commitment Amendment”) amending Schedule 2.01 to reflect such Additional Revolving Commitments and implementing such additional amendments to this Agreement as shall be appropriate, in the judgment of the Administrative Agent, to provide the rights and benefits of this Agreement and other Loan Documents to such Additional Revolving Commitments and the extensions of credit made pursuant thereto, and such amendment will be effective to amend this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on the terms set forth therein without the consent of any other Lender, any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender. The terms of any such Additional Revolving Commitments and the extensions of credit made pursuant thereto shall be identical to those of the other Revolving Commitments and the extensions of credit made pursuant thereto.63(d) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender as to the effectiveness of each Incremental Term Loan Amendment and each Additional Revolving Commitment Amendment.(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing but subject to Section 1.06, no new Loans or Commitments shall be made or established under this Section (including through the conversion of existing Loans or Commitments) unless (i) on the date such Loans are made or the date such Commitments become effective, (x) the conditions set forth in clauses (a) and (b) of Section 4.02 shall be satisfied, and (y) the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate to that effect dated such date and executed by a Financial Officer and (ii) the Administrative Agent shall have received legal opinions, board resolutions and other closing certificates and documentation reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent consistent with those delivered on Effective Date pursuant to Section 4.01.(f) Upon the making of any Incremental Term Loan or the effectiveness of any Additional Revolving Commitment of any Incremental Lender that is not already a Lender pursuant to this Section, such Incremental Lender shall be deemed to be a “Lender” (and a Lender in respect of Loans and Commitments of the applicable Class) hereunder, and henceforth shall be entitled to all the rights of, and benefits accruing to, Lenders (or Lenders in respect of Loans and Commitments of the applicable Class) hereunder and shall be bound by all agreements, acknowledgements and other obligations of Lenders (or Lenders in respect of Loans and Commitments of the applicable Class) hereunder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon the effectiveness of an Additional Revolving Commitment of any Incremental Lender, such Incremental Lender shall be deemed to have acquired, on the terms set forth in Section 2.05, participations in outstanding Letters of Credit equal to such Revolving Lender’s Applicable Aggregate Revolving Percentage.(g) Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that the Administrative Agent may take any and all actions that it deems necessary or advisable to ensure that, after giving effect to any Additional Revolving Commitments established pursuant to clause (a)(ii) of this Section, the outstanding Revolving Loans are held by the Revolving Lenders in accordance with their new Applicable Aggregate Revolving Percentages. This may be accomplished at the discretion of the Administrative Agent (i) by requiring outstanding Revolving Loans to be prepaid with the proceeds of a new Revolving Borrowing, (ii) by permitting the Revolving Borrowings outstanding at the time of any increase in the aggregate Revolving Commitments pursuant to this Section to remain outstanding until the last days of the respective Interest Periods therefor, even though the applicable Revolving Lenders would hold such Revolving Borrowings other than in accordance with their new Applicable Aggregate Revolving Percentages, or (iii) by any combination of the foregoing. Any prepayment described in this paragraph shall be subject to Section 2.16, but otherwise shall be without premium or penalty.SECTION 2.21 Defaulting Lenders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, to the extent there is an obligation of a Lender to acquire participations in Swingline Loans or Letters of Credit at the time a Lender having a Revolving Commitment becomes a Defaulting Lender then:(a) all or any part of such commitment to acquire participations in Swingline Loans and Letters of Credit shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Aggregate Revolving Percentages (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lender’s Revolving Commitment) but only to the extent (i) the sum of the non-Defaulting Lenders’ Applicable Aggregate Revolving Percentage of the Revolving Exposure plus such Defaulting Lender’s Applicable Aggregate Revolving Percentage of Revolving Exposure do not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders’ Revolving Commitments, (ii) the amount reallocated to any such non-Defaulting Lender shall not exceed such Lender’s unutilized Revolving Commitment and (iii) the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 are satisfied at such time;64(b) if the reallocation described in clause (a) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall (i) first, within 1 Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent, prepay any outstanding Swingline Loans to the extent the Swingline Loan Commitments related thereto have not been reallocated pursuant to clause (a) above and (ii) second, within 5 Business Days following notice by the Administrative Agent, cash collateralize such Defaulting Lender’s Applicable Aggregate Revolving Percentage of the LC Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (a) above) for so long as such LC Commitment is outstanding; and(c) if the Applicable Aggregate Revolving Percentage of the non-Defaulting Lenders’ LC Exposure is reallocated pursuant to clause (a) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.12 shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders’ Applicable Aggregate Revolving Percentage.If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Swingline Lender and Issuing Bank agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any cash collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans to be held pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans to be held pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with the Revolving Commitments (in each case, without giving effect to this first paragraph of this Section 2.21, whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender); provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.SECTION 2.22 Removal or Replacement of a Lender. Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that: (a) (i) any Lender (an “Increased Cost Lender”) shall give notice to the Borrower that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under Section 2.15 or 2.17, (ii) the circumstances which entitle such Lender to receive such payments shall remain in effect, and (iii) such Lender shall fail to withdraw such notice within five Business Days after the Borrower’s request for such withdrawal; or (b) any Lender shall become a Defaulting Lender and such Defaulting Lender shall fail to cure the default as a result of which it has become a Defaulting Lender within 5 Business Days after the Borrower’s request that it cure such default; or (c) in connection with any proposed amendment, modification, termination, waiver or consent with respect to any of the provisions hereof as contemplated by Section 9.02, the consent of Required Lenders shall have been obtained but the consent of one or more of such other Lenders (each a “Non-Consenting Lender”) whose consent is required shall not have been obtained; then, with respect to each such Increased Cost Lender, Defaulting Lender or Non-Consenting Lender (the “Terminated Lender”), the Borrower may, by giving written notice to the Administrative Agent and any Terminated Lender of its election to do so, elect to cause such Terminated Lender (and such Terminated Lender hereby irrevocably agrees) to assign its outstanding Loans and its Revolving Commitments, if any, in full to one or more assignees (each a “Replacement Lender”) in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.04 and the Borrower shall pay the fees, if any, payable thereunder in connection with any such assignment from a Terminated Lender; provided, that (1) on the date of such assignment, the Replacement Lender shall pay to the Terminated Lender an amount equal to the sum of (A) an amount equal to the principal of, and all accrued interest on, all outstanding Loans of the Terminated Lender, (B) an amount equal to all unreimbursed drawings that have been funded by such Terminated Lender, together with all then unpaid interest with respect thereto at such time and (C) an amount equal to all accrued but theretofore unpaid fees owing to such Terminated Lender pursuant to Section 2.12; (2) on the date of such assignment, the Borrower shall pay any amounts payable to such Terminated Lender pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17 or otherwise as if it were a prepayment and (3) in the event such Terminated Lender is a Non-Consenting Lender, each Replacement Lender shall consent, at the time of such assignment, to each matter in respect of which such Terminated Lender was a Non-65Consenting Lender; provided, that the Borrower may not make such election with respect to any Terminated Lender that is also the Issuing Bank unless, prior to the effectiveness of such election, the Borrower shall have caused each outstanding Letter of Credit issued thereby to be cancelled or cash collateralized or supported by a backup letter of credit in each case on terms reasonably acceptable to such Terminated Lender. Upon the prepayment of all amounts owing to any Terminated Lender and the termination of such Terminated Lender’s Revolving Commitment, if any, such Terminated Lender shall no longer constitute a “Lender” for purposes hereof; provided, that any rights of such Terminated Lender to indemnification hereunder arising with respect to events occurring prior to such termination shall survive as to such Terminated Lender. Each Lender agrees that if the Borrower exercises its option hereunder to cause an assignment by such Lender as a Terminated Lender, such Lender shall, promptly after receipt of written notice of such election, execute and deliver all documentation necessary to effectuate such assignment in accordance with Section 9.04. In the event that a Lender does not comply with the requirements of the immediately preceding sentence within 1 Business Day after receipt of such notice, each Lender hereby authorizes and directs the Administrative Agent to execute and deliver such documentation as may be required to give effect to an assignment in accordance with Section 9.04 on behalf of a Terminated Lender and any such documentation so executed by the Administrative Agent shall be effective for purposes of documenting an assignment pursuant to Section 9.04.SECTION 2.23 Extension Offers. (a)  The Borrower may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent, make one or more offers (each, an “Extension Offer”) to all of the Lenders of any Class of Term Loans or Revolving Commitments (each Class subject to such an Extension Offer being referred to as an “Extension Request Class”), on the same terms and conditions, and on a pro rata basis, to each Lender within any Extension Request Class, to make one or more Extension Amendments pursuant to procedures reasonably specified by the Administrative Agent. Such notice shall set forth (i) the terms and conditions of the requested Extension Amendment and (ii) the date on which such Extension Amendment is requested to become effective (which shall not be less than 5 Business Days or more than 60 Business Days after the date of such notice, unless otherwise agreed to by the Administrative Agent). No Lender shall be obligated to extend its Term Loans or Revolving Commitments unless it so agrees. Extension Amendments shall become effective only with respect to the Loans and Commitments of the Lenders of the Extension Request Class that accept the applicable Extension Offer (such Lenders, the “Extending Lenders”) and, in the case of any Extending Lender, only with respect to such Lender’s Loans and Commitments of such Extension Request Class as to which such Lender’s acceptance has been made. Any Extended Loans or Extended Commitments shall constitute a separate Class of Loans or Commitments from the Extension Request Class from which they were converted and, in the event any Extended Term Loans have the same terms as any existing Class of Term Loans then outstanding or any Incremental Term Loans then substantially concurrently established (in each case, disregarding any differences in original issue discount or upfront fees if not affecting the fungibility thereof for US federal income tax purposes), such Extended Term Loans may, at the election of the Borrower, be treated as a single Class with such outstanding Term Loans or such Incremental Term Loans, and the scheduled Term Loan amortization amount set forth in Section 2.09(a) with respect to any such Class of Term Loans may be increased to reflect scheduled amortization of such Extended Term Loans. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Administrative Agent each Extension Offer shall be in a minimum principal amount (to be specified in the relevant Extension Offer) for the applicable Class to be extended of (A) $100,000,000 with respect to Term Loans and (B) $50,000,000 with respect to Revolving Commitments (in each case, or, if less, the remaining amount of such Class); provided that, the Borrower may, at their option and subject to their right to waive any such condition in its sole discretion, further specify as a condition to the effectiveness of any Extension Amendment that a higher minimum amount, as specified in the Extension Offer, of Loans and Commitments of the Extension Request Class consent thereto. The Borrower may amend, revoke or replace any Extension Offer at any time prior to the effectiveness of the applicable Extension Agreement. In connection with any Extension Offer, the Borrower shall agree to such procedures, if any, as may be reasonably established by, or acceptable to, the Administrative Agent to accomplish the purposes of this Section 2.23.66(b) An Extension Amendment shall be effected pursuant to an Extension Agreement executed and delivered by the Borrower, each applicable Extending Lender and the Administrative Agent; provided that no Extension Amendment shall become effective unless the Loan Parties shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent such legal opinions, board resolutions, secretary’s certificates, officer’s certificates, reaffirmation agreements and other documents (consistent (to the extent applicable) in all material respects with the corresponding documents delivered under Section 4.01 on the Effective Date) as shall reasonably be requested by the Administrative Agent in connection therewith. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender as to the effectiveness of each Extension Agreement. Each Extension Agreement may, without the consent of any Lender other than the applicable Extending Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent, to give effect to the provisions of this Section 2.23, including (i) a reduction to the scheduled Term Loan amortization amount required pursuant to Section 2.09(a) with respect to Loans of the Extension Request Class to reflect the treatment of the Extended Loans as a new Class of Loans (it being understood that the amount of any scheduled amortization payable to any non-Extending Lender with respect to its Loans of the Extension Request Class shall not be reduced as a result thereof) and (ii) any amendments necessary to treat the applicable Loans and/or Commitments of the Extending Lenders as a new “Class” of loans and/or commitments hereunder (including for purposes of prepayments and voting) (it being agreed that such new Class of Loans may be included in the definitions of “Required Lenders” and, as applicable, “Required Facility Lenders” and may be afforded Class voting rights requiring the consent of Lenders under such Class in addition to any other consent of Lenders that might otherwise be required under Section 9.02); provided that, in the case of any Extension Offer relating to Revolving Commitments or Revolving Loans, (A) the borrowing and repayment (except for repayments required upon the maturity and repayments made in connection with a permanent repayment and termination of the applicable Commitments) of Loans under the Commitments of such new Class and the remaining Revolving Commitments shall be made on a ratable basis as between the Commitments of such new Class and the remaining Revolving Commitments, (B) the allocation of the participation exposure with respect to any then-existing or subsequently issued Letter of Credit or Swingline Loan as between the Commitments of such new Class and the remaining Revolving Commitments shall be made on a ratable basis as between the Commitments of such new Class and the remaining Revolving Commitments (and the applicable Extension Agreement shall contain reallocation and cash collateralization provisions, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, with respect to Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans outstanding on the Maturity Date for Revolving Loans) and (C) the Availability Period and the Maturity Date for Revolving Loans, as such terms are used in reference to Letters of Credit of the Issuing Bank or to Swingline Loans, may not be extended without the prior written consent of the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be.ARTICLE IIIREPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIESThe Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders that:SECTION 3.01 Organization and Authority.

Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks hereby irrevocably appoints the Agents as its agents and authorizes the Agents to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to them by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.The provisions of this Section 8.01 (other than as expressly provided herein) are solely for the benefit of the Agents and the Lenders and no Loan Party shall have any rights as a third-party beneficiary of any of the provisions of this Section 8.01 (other than as expressly provided herein). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any provision of any other Loan Document, each of the Joint Lead Arrangers, the Syndication Agent, the Co-Documentation Agents and the Joint Bookrunners are named as such for recognition purposes only, and in their respective capacities as such shall have no duties, responsibilities or liabilities with respect to this Agreement or any other Loan Document; it being understood and agreed that each of the Joint Lead Arrangers, the Syndication Agent, the Co-Documentation Agent and the Joint Bookrunners shall be entitled to all indemnification and reimbursement rights in favor of the Agents provided herein and in the other Loan Documents and all of the other benefits of this Section 8.01. Each of the Syndication Agent, the Co-Documentation Agents and the Joint Lead Arrangers and the Joint Bookrunners, without consent of or notice to any party hereto, may assign any and all of its rights or obligations hereunder to any of its Affiliates. Without limitation of the foregoing, neither the Joint Lead Arrangers, the Syndication Agent, the Co-Documentation Agents nor the Joint Bookrunners in their respective capacities as such shall, by reason of this Agreement or any other 94Loan Document, have any fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender, Loan Party or any other Person.The bank serving as the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent.The Agents shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Agents shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) neither Agent shall have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers unless and until such Agent shall have received instructions from the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances, as provided in Section 9.02) and, upon receipt of such instructions from Required Lenders (or such other Lenders, as the case may be), such Agent shall be entitled to act or (where so instructed) refrain from acting, or to exercise such power, discretion or authority, in accordance with such instructions and shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose such Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Agents shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. Neither Agent shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) under or in connection with any Loan Document or (ii) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction). Neither Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to such Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and neither Agent shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered thereunder or in connection therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in any Loan Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to such Agent.Each Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. Each Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Agents may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by them, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by them in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.Each Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by it. Each Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through its respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Agents and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent. All of the rights, benefits, and privileges (including the exculpatory and indemnification provisions) of this paragraph and of Section 9.03 shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities as sub-agent as if such sub-agent and Related Parties were named herein. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to each such sub-agent appointed by an Agent, (i) such sub-agent shall be a third-party 95beneficiary under this Agreement with respect to all such rights, benefits and privileges (including exculpatory rights and rights to indemnification) and shall have all of the rights and benefits of a third-party beneficiary, including an independent right of action to enforce such rights, benefits and privileges (including exculpatory rights and rights to indemnification) directly, without the consent or joinder of any other Person, against any or all of Loan Parties and the Lenders, (ii) such rights, benefits and privileges (including exculpatory rights and rights to indemnification) of such sub-agent shall not be modified or amended without the consent of such sub-agent, and (iii) such sub-agent shall only have obligations to the Administrative Agent and not to any Loan Party, Lender or any other Person and no Loan Party, Lender or any other Person shall have any rights, directly or indirectly, as a third-party beneficiary or otherwise, against such sub-agent.Each Lender, in proportion to its Applicable Aggregate Percentage, severally agrees to indemnify each Agent, Issuing Bank and Swingline Lender, to the extent that such Agent, Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender shall not have been reimbursed by any Loan Party (and without limiting its obligation to do so), for and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses (including counsel fees and disbursements) or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Agent, Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender in exercising its powers, rights and remedies or performing its duties hereunder or under the other Loan Documents or otherwise in its capacity as such Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents; provided, that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from such Agent’s, Issuing Bank’s Swingline Lender’s, as applicable gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. If any indemnity furnished to any Agent, Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender, for any purpose shall, in the opinion of such Agent, Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender, as applicable, be insufficient or become impaired, such Agent, Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender, as applicable, may call for additional indemnity and cease, or not commence, to do the acts indemnified against until such additional indemnity is furnished; provided, that in no event shall this sentence require any Lender to indemnify any Agent, Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender against any liability, obligation, loss, damage, penalty, action, judgment, suit, cost, expense or disbursement in excess of such Lender’s Applicable Aggregate Revolving Percentage thereof; and provided, further, that this sentence shall not be deemed to require any Lender to indemnify any Agent, Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender against any liability, obligation, loss, damage, penalty, action, judgment, suit, cost, expense or disbursement described in the proviso in the immediately preceding sentence.The Administrative Agent shall have the right to resign at any time by giving prior written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower. The Administrative Agent shall have the right to appoint a financial institution to act as the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent hereunder, subject to the reasonable satisfaction of the Borrower and the Required Lenders, and the Administrative Agent’s resignation shall become effective on the earlier of (i) the acceptance of such successor Administrative Agent by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or (ii) the thirtieth day after such notice of resignation. Upon any such notice of resignation, if a successor Administrative Agent has not already been appointed by the retiring Administrative Agent, the Required Lenders shall have the right, upon 5 Business Days’ notice to the Borrower, to appoint a successor Administrative Agent subject to the reasonable satisfaction of the Borrower. If neither the Required Lenders nor the Administrative Agent have appointed a successor Administrative Agent, then the Required Lenders shall be deemed to have succeeded to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent; provided, that until a successor Administrative Agent is so appointed by Required Lenders or the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent, by notice to the Borrower and Required Lenders, may retain its role as the Collateral Agent under any Security Document. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as the Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, that successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring the Administrative Agent and the retiring the Administrative Agent shall promptly (i) transfer to such successor Administrative Agent all sums, securities and other items of Collateral held under the Security Documents, together with all records and other documents necessary or appropriate in connection with the performance of the duties of the successor Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents, and (ii) execute and deliver to such successor Administrative Agent such amendments to financing statements, and take such other actions, as may be necessary or appropriate in 96connection with the assignment to such successor Administrative Agent of the security interests created under the Security Documents, whereupon such retiring the Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder.

Any successor Administrative Agent appointed pursuant to this paragraph shall, upon its acceptance of such appointment, become the successor Collateral Agent for all purposes hereunder. If Barclays Bank or its successor as Administrative Agent pursuant to this paragraph has resigned as Administrative Agent but retained its role as Collateral Agent and no successor Collateral Agent has become the Collateral Agent pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, Barclays Bank or its successor may resign as Collateral Agent upon notice to the Borrower and Required Lenders at any time. After any retiring Agent’s resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Agent, its respective Related Parties that at any time acted as a sub-agent in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Agent was acting as Agent. In no event shall a Disqualified Institution be appointed an Agent hereunder.Any resignation of Barclays Bank or its successor as the Administrative Agent pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall also constitute the resignation of Barclays Bank or its successor as the Swingline Lender, and any successor Administrative Agent appointed pursuant to this Section 8.01 shall, upon its acceptance of such appointment, become the successor Swingline Lender for all purposes hereunder. In such event (a) the Borrower shall prepay any outstanding Swingline Loans made by the retiring Administrative Agent in its capacity as Swingline Lender, (b) upon such prepayment, the retiring Administrative Agent and Swingline Lender shall surrender any Note for the Swingline Loan held by it to the Borrower for cancellation and (c) the Borrower shall issue, if so requested by the successor Administrative Agent and the Swingline Lender, a new Note for the Swingline Loan to the successor Administrative Agent and the Swingline Lender, in the principal amount of the Swingline Loan then in effect and with other appropriate insertions.In addition to the foregoing, the Collateral Agent may resign at any time by giving 30 days’ prior written notice thereof to Lenders and the Loan Parties. The Administrative Agent shall have the right to appoint a financial institution as Collateral Agent hereunder, subject to the reasonable satisfaction of the Borrower and the Required Lenders and the Collateral Agent’s resignation shall become effective on the earlier of (a) the acceptance of such successor Collateral Agent by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or (b) the thirtieth day after such notice of resignation. Upon any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, upon 5 Business Days’ notice to the Administrative Agent, to appoint a successor Collateral Agent. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Collateral Agent hereunder by a successor Collateral Agent, the successor Collateral Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Collateral Agent under this Agreement and the Security Documents, and the retiring Collateral Agent under this Agreement shall promptly (i) transfer to such successor Collateral Agent all sums, securities and other items of Collateral held hereunder or under the Security Documents, together with all records and other documents necessary or appropriate in connection with the performance of the duties of the successor Collateral Agent under this Agreement and the Security Documents, and (ii) execute and deliver to such successor Collateral Agent or otherwise authorize the filing of such amendments to financing statements, and take such other actions, as may be necessary or appropriate in connection with the assignment to such successor Collateral Agent of the security interests created under the Security Documents, whereupon such retiring Collateral Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement and the Security Documents. After any retiring Collateral Agent’s resignation hereunder as the Collateral Agent, the provisions of this Agreement and the Security Documents shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it under this Agreement or the Security Documents while it was the Collateral Agent hereunder.Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon either Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it 97will, independently and without reliance upon either Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.Each Lender, by delivering its '],\n",

Sales of the Shares made pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, if any, may be made in “at the market offerings” as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act, including sales made directly on the New York Stock Exchange, the existing trading market for shares of our common stock, or sales made to or through a market maker or through an electronic communications network or by such other methods, including privately negotiated transactions (including block transactions), as we and any Sales Agent agree to in writing. Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company from time to time, including (among others) market conditions, the trading price of our common stock, capital needs and determinations by the Company of the appropriate sources of funding for the Company. In addition to the issuance and sale of Shares by the Company through the Sales Agents, the Company also may enter into forward stock purchase transactions with the Forward Purchasers as set forth in a separate letter agreement (each, a “Forward Agreement”), a form of which is attached as Exhibit B to the Distribution Agreement. In connection with each Forward Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions of the Distribution Agreement, the applicable Forward Purchaser will borrow from third parties and, through a Sales Agent (each Sales Agent when acting in such capacity is referred to as a “Forward Seller”), sell a number of Shares equal to the number of shares of the Company’s common stock underlying such Forward Agreement to hedge such Forward Agreement.The Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of borrowed shares of common stock by a Forward Seller. The Company expects to receive proceeds from the sale of Shares upon future physical settlement(s) of the relevant Forward Agreement with the relevant Forward Purchaser on dates specified by the Company on or prior to the maturity date of such Forward Agreement, in which case, the Company will expect to receive, subject to certain adjustments, aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of Shares underlying the relevant Forward Agreement, multiplied by the relevant forward sale price. Although the Company expects to settle any Forward Agreement with a full physical settlement, it may, except in limited circumstances, elect a cash or net share settlement of such Forward Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions of the Distribution Agreement. If the Company elects to cash settle or net share settle a Forward Agreement, the Company may not receive any proceeds (in the case of cash settlement) or will not receive any proceeds (in the case of net share settlement), and the Company may owe cash (in the case of cash settlement) or shares of Common Stock (in the case of net share settlement) to the relevant Forward Purchaser. Each Forward Purchaser will have the right to accelerate its Forward Agreement and require the Company to physically settle on a date specified by the Forward Purchaser under the terms described in the Forward Agreement.The offer and sales of the Shares, if any, made pursuant to the Distribution Agreement and any Forward Agreement, will be made under the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-3ASR, which was previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and became automatically effective on March 2, 2022, as supplemented by a prospectus supplement, dated November 10, 2022.The Company is not obligated to, and it cannot provide any assurances that it will, make any sales of the Shares under the Distribution Agreement or any Forward Agreement. The Company will pay each Sales Agent a commission rate of up to 2% of the gross sales price per share of any Shares sold through such Sales Agent as agent under the Distribution Agreement, as well as reimbursement of certain expenses. The Distribution Agreement may be terminated by the Company at any time upon prior written notice to the Sales Agent and Forwards Purchasers or by any Sales Agent or any Forward Purchaser with respect to itself at any time upon prior written notice to the Company.This Current Report on Form 8-K shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of any offer to buy the Shares, nor shall there be an offer, solicitation or sale of the Shares in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such state.The foregoing description of the Distribution Agreement and Forward Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreements.

Each Agent and Forward Purchaser, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in Section 9(a) hereof, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including any information deemed to be a part thereof pursuant to Rule 430B, or in the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with the information furnished to the Company by such Agent in writing expressly for use therein. The Company acknowledges that the 25statements set forth (i) the first sentence of the fifth paragraph under “Plan of Distribution (Conflicts of Interest)” and (ii) the tenth and eleventh paragraphs of text under “Plan of Distribution (Conflicts of Interest)” in the Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Agents for inclusion in the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.(c)Actions against Parties; Notification. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 9 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 9, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party’s choice at the indemnifying party’s expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); provided, that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party’s election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.(d)Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse. If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 9(a)(ii) hereof effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. 10.Contribution. If recovery is not available or insufficient to hold the indemnified party harmless under Section 9 hereof for any reason other than as specified therein, the indemnified party shall be entitled to contribution 26for any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses for which such indemnification is so unavailable or insufficient under this Section 10. In determining the amount of contribution to which such indemnified party is entitled, there shall be considered the portion of the proceeds of the offering of the Shares realized by the Company on the one hand and the Agents and Forward Purchasers on the other hand, the relative knowledge and access to information concerning the matter with respect to which the claim was asserted, the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or omission, and any equitable considerations appropriate under the circumstances. The Company and the Agents and Forward Purchasers agree that it would not be equitable if the amount of such contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation (even if the Agents and Forward Purchasers were treated as one entity for such purpose) without reference to the considerations called for in the previous sentence. No Agent or Forward Purchaser or any person controlling such Agent or Forward Purchaser shall be obligated to contribute any amount or amounts hereunder which in the aggregate exceeds the total discounts and commissions received by such Agent, or in the case of a Forward Purchaser the net Spread (as such term is defined in the applicable Confirmations and net of any related stock borrow costs or other costs or expenses actually incurred) for all Confirmations entered into pursuant to this Agreement, with respect to the offering of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement and any Terms Agreement, less the aggregate amount of any damages which such Agent or Forward Purchaser and its controlling persons have otherwise been required to pay in respect of the same claim or any substantially similar claim. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

Rayonier may use a portion of the amounts available under the Revolving Credit Facility to finance the previously announced acquisition of Pope Resources, A Delaware Limited Partnership (“Pope Resources”) and the related fees and expenses.New Incremental Term LoanOn April 16, 2020, the Borrowers entered into a Third Amendment and Incremental Term Loan Agreement (the “Amendment Agreement”) with the Lenders party thereto, the Administrative Agent and the other parties thereto, to amend certain terms of the Credit Agreement and to provide an additional senior unsecured incremental term loan facility to ROC in an aggregate amount of $250 million (the “2020 Incremental Term Loan Facility”) to be advanced by certain Lenders providing commitments under the 2020 Incremental Term Loan Facility, which Rayonier expects to use to finance the acquisition of Pope Resources and the related fees and expenses. The periodic interest rate on the 2020 Incremental Term Loan Facility is based, at ROC’s option, on either (1) a Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin (currently 1.850%) based on the ratio of consolidated funded debt of Rayonier and its subsidiaries to the sum of the consolidated net worth of Rayonier and its subsidiaries plus the consolidated funded debt of Rayonier and its subsidiaries (the “Leverage Ratio”) or (2) the highest of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus ½ of 1.00%, and (c) the one-month Eurodollar rate plus 1.00%, plus an applicable margin (currently 0.850%) based on the Leverage Ratio. Interest is payable either quarterly or every one, two, or three months, depending on which type of interest rate is selected by ROC. The 2020 Incremental Term Loan Facility allows for the Borrowers to receive annual patronage payments, which are profit distributions made by a cooperative to its member-users based on the quantity or value of business done with the member-user.All advances made under the 2020 Incremental Term Loan Facility must be repaid by ROC on April 16, 2025. Advances made under the 2020 Incremental Term Loan Facility may be prepaid by ROC, without penalty (other than payment of customary breakage costs for payment of an advance accruing interest at the Eurodollar rate prior to the end of the interest period for such advance), at any time in whole or part.The 2020 Incremental Term Loan Facility will be subject to the covenants and events of default contained in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains financial covenants related to leverage and interest coverage, as well as other affirmative and negative covenants relating to, among other things, dividends, liens, mergers, dispositions of timber and timberlands, subsidiary debt, sales and issuances of capital stock of subsidiaries, and affiliate transactions. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the Lenders holding more than 50% of the outstanding amount of the commitments and advances under the credit facilities thereunder may accelerate amounts due under the Credit Agreement (except in the case of a bankruptcy or insolvency event of default, in which case such amounts shall automatically become due and payable).Some of the Lenders and potential lenders under the Credit Agreement (and their respective subsidiaries or affiliates) have in the past provided, and may in the future provide, investment banking, underwriting, lending, commercial banking, trust and other advisory services to Rayonier and its subsidiaries and affiliates. These parties have received, and may in the future receive, customary compensation from Rayonier and its subsidiaries and affiliates for such services.1Table of ContentsFor additional information on the Credit Agreement and facilities thereunder, including the terms thereof, see Rayonier’s Current Reports on Form 8-K dated August 5, 2015, May 5, 2016 and April 2, 2020.

Prior to such contribution, all of the business and operations of Rayonier were conducted through ROC and ROC and/or its subsidiaries held substantially all of Rayonier’s assets. As a result of the contribution, which constituted the transfer of all or substantially all of Rayonier’s assets under the terms of the Indenture, dated March 5, 2012 (as supplemented and amended from time to time, the “Indenture”), between Rayonier, as issuer, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, Opco expressly assumed all the obligations of Rayonier under the Indenture, including obligations with respect to the outstanding $325,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 3.750% Senior Notes due 2022 (the “2022 Notes”) issued thereunder. On May 7, 2020, Rayonier, Opco, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto and the Trustee entered into the Third Supplemental Indenture, pursuant to which (1) Opco succeeded to and became substituted for the Company under the Indenture and 2022 Notes and expressly assumed all the obligations of the Company under the Indenture, including the 2022 Notes, and (2) Rayonier agreed to irrevocably, fully and unconditionally guarantee, jointly and severally, the obligations of Opco under Indenture, including the 2022 Notes.The foregoing description of the Third Supplemental Indenture does not purport to be complete and1Table of Contentsis qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Third Supplemental Indenture, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.Tax Protection AgreementIn connection with the closing of the Mergers contemplated by the Merger Agreement, on May 8, 2020, Rayonier, Opco and Pope entered into a Tax Protection Agreement (the “Tax Protection Agreement”). Under the Tax Protection Agreement, Opco agrees to indemnify qualified holders of Opco units (which are persons who received in the Mergers and beneficially own 525,000 or more Opco units) for the time value of money (determined based on the prime rate plus 2%) if Opco triggers, at any time during the five year period following the closing of the Mergers, a certain amount of U.S. federal, state and local income taxes with respect to such holder’s share of built-in gain with respect to the real property assets directly or indirectly owned by Pope immediately before the Mergers, with certain exceptions.The foregoing description of the Tax Protection Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Tax Protection Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.ITEM 2.01.Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.On May 8, 2020, Rayonier and Opco completed the business combination contemplated by the Merger Agreement. As a result of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Opco indirectly acquired all of the issued and outstanding limited partnership interests of Pope and became the sole general partner of Pope. At the closing of the Mergers, each unit representing limited partnership interests of Pope (the “Pope Units”) outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Mergers were, at the election of their holders and subject to proration described below, converted into the right to receive:•$125.00 in cash (the “Cash Election Consideration”);•3.929 shares of Rayonier common stock (“Rayonier Shares”) (the “Stock Election Consideration”); or•3.929 units representing limited partnership interests of Opco (“Opco Units”) (the “Opco Election Consideration”).Each of the Cash Election Consideration, Stock Election Consideration and Opco Election Consideration were subject to proration so that approximately 70% of the Pope Units converted into merger consideration were exchanged for Rayonier Shares or Opco Units and approximately 30% of the Pope Units converted into merger consideration were exchanged for cash. These proration procedures were to ensure that the aggregate amount of Rayonier Shares and Opco Units, on the one hand, and cash, on the other hand, issued in the merger to acquire Pope equaled the amounts issued as if every Pope Unit converted into merger consideration received 2.751 Rayonier Shares or Opco Units and $37.50 in cash. In addition, Pope unitholders that elected to receive the Cash Election Consideration could designate whether, in the event that the cash consideration was oversubscribed, each Pope Unit for which they have made a cash election was prorated into (a) Rayonier Shares and cash or (b) Opco Units and cash (the “Proration Election”). The results of the elections made by Pope unitholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement and consideration to be received in connection with the merger to acquire Pope are as follows:•Cash Elections: Approximately 79.1% of Pope Units converted into the merger consideration, or 3,362,593 Pope Units, elected to receive the Cash Election Consideration. Therefore, cash elections were oversubscribed and were subject to the proration procedures set forth in the Merger Agreement and described above. As a result of such proration, each Pope Unit for which a valid cash election was made was converted into the right to receive $47.42 in cash and 2.439 Rayonier Shares or Opco Units (depending on the Proration Election of its holder).•Stock Elections: Approximately 1.8% of Pope Units converted into the merger consideration, or 76,090 Pope Units, elected to receive the Stock Election Consideration. Pope unitholders who elected to receive the Stock Election Consideration with respect to their Pope Units will receive 2Table of Contents3.929 Rayonier Shares for each Pope Unit so elected. In addition, approximately 8.4% of Pope Units converted into the merger consideration, or 359,953 Pope Units, did not submit a valid election by the election deadline. Per the Merger Agreement, all of such Pope Units will be treated as having made the Stock Election and, upon completion by its holder of a letter of transmittal to be mailed by Rayonier’s exchange agent, receive 3.929 Rayonier Shares for each such Pope Unit. •Opco Elections: Approximately 10.7% of Pope Units converted into the merger consideration, or 453,600 Pope Units, elected to receive the Opco Election Consideration. Pope unitholders who elected to receive the Opco Election Consideration with respect to their Pope Units will receive 3.929 Opco Units for each Pope Unit so elected.Based on these elections, Rayonier expects approximately 7,141,264 Rayonier Shares, 4,556,638 Opco Units and $159,458,868 in cash will be issued in connection with the merger to acquire Pope. In addition, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Rayonier will pay an aggregate of $10 million in cash to the holders of shares of MGP common stock and EGP common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger to acquire the general partners of Pope. In addition, at the closing, subject to certain exceptions, each outstanding restricted Pope Unit (Pope Restricted Unit”) under Pope’s equity compensation plans (the “Pope Equity Plans”) was converted into restricted Rayonier Shares on substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the Pope Restricted Units prior to the closing, with the number of Rayonier Shares subject to each such Pope award equal to the number of Pope Units subject to the applicable Pope Restricted Unit award immediately prior to the closing multiplied by 3.929. At the closing, Rayonier also assumed all of Pope’s obligations under the Pope Equity Plans, except that the number of units available for issuance under the Pope Equity Plans were adjusted to reflect Rayonier Shares.The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby is not complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which was filed as Exhibit 2.1 to Rayonier’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on January 15, 2020, and Amendment No. 1 thereto, a copy of which was filed as Exhibit 2.1 to Rayonier’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 2, 2020, each which is incorporated herein by reference.ITEM 2.03.Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.The information provided in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03.ITEM 3.03.Material Modification to Rights of Security Holders.In connection with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, on May 8, 2020, Opco amended and restated its limited partnership agreement (as so amended, the “Amended Limited Partnership Agreement”). The Amended Limited Partnership Agreement provides, among other things, that  the Opco Units can be redeemed by its holder for cash based on the market price of Rayonier Shares or, at Rayonier’s option, exchanged for Rayonier Shares on a 1:1 basis following a 60-day notice period. If a holder of Opco Units desires to redeem its Opco Units, such holder is required to submit for redemption at least 1,000 Opco Units or, if such holder owns fewer than 1,000 Opco units, all the Opco Units owned by such holder. In addition, under the Amended Limited Partnership Agreement, all management powers over the business and affairs of Opco are exclusively vested in Rayonier, as Opco’s general partner, including the ability to make any expenditures or borrow money, the acquisition or disposition of assets, the management of any property, the execution and performance of contracts and the issuance of additional Opco Units.The definitive proxy statement/prospectus, dated April 6, 2020, of Pope that forms part of the registration statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-237246) filed with the SEC by Rayonier and Opco contains additional information about the rights of holders of Opco Units under the Amended Limited Partnership Agreement under the heading “Description of Opco Units.”3Table of ContentsThe foregoing description of the Amended Limited Partnership Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Amended Limited Partnership Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Based on currently available information, we estimate that approximately 10,000 acres of our timberland properties in Louisiana sustained severe damage from the storm, the majority of which appear to be contained in recently thinned stands. Additionally, during the last week, the Beachie Creek fire in Oregon spread through approximately 9,000 acres of land owned by ORM Timber Fund II, which Rayonier manages and in which Rayonier holds a 20% economic interest, and the Slater fire in Oregon spread through approximately 1,000 acres of land owned by ORM Timber Fund IV, which Rayonier manages and in which Rayonier holds a 15% economic interest. While information as to the extent of damage sustained from these fire events is limited, we expect that the level of damage may vary widely across the affected areas. We are currently assessing the magnitude of the damage and determining the salvage potential for the affected properties in both Louisiana and Oregon. Based on information currently available, we do not expect the damage to our timberlands from these events to have a material impact on our financial condition. We expect to provide a further update as to the extent of the damage from these events by no later than our third quarter earnings call. No employees of Rayonier sustained injuries from these events.

(“Rayonier”), Rayonier TRS Holdings Inc. (“TRS”), Rayonier Operating Company LLC (“ROC”) and Rayonier, L.P. (“RLP,” collectively with Rayonier, TRS and ROC, each individually a “Borrower” and collectively, the “Borrowers”) entered into a Fourth Amendment and Incremental Term Loan Agreement (the “Amendment Agreement”) with the several banks, financial institutions and other institutional lenders party thereto (the “Lenders”) and COBANK, ACB, as administrative agent (the Administrative Agent”), to amend certain terms of the Credit Agreement (as defined below) and to provide a senior unsecured incremental term loan facility to RLP (the “2021 Incremental Term Loan Facility”) in an aggregate amount of $200 million (the “Commitment Amount”).The 2021 Incremental Term Loan Facility provides for the Lenders to make an advance of the Commitment Amount to RLP on or before June 1, 2022, at RLP’s election. As of June 4, 2021, no advance has been made to RLP. RLP expects to use any future advance under the 2021 Incremental Term Loan Facility to refinance the 3.750% senior notes due April 2022 at or prior to maturity, repay other debt or for general corporate purposes. The periodic interest rate on the 2021 Incremental Term Loan Facility is based, at RLP’s option, on either (1) a Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin (currently 1.550%) based on the ratio of consolidated funded debt of Rayonier and its subsidiaries to the sum of the consolidated net worth of Rayonier and its subsidiaries plus the consolidated funded debt of Rayonier and its subsidiaries (the “Leverage Ratio”) or (2) the highest of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus ½ of 1.00%, and (c) the one-month Eurodollar rate plus 1.00%, plus an applicable margin (currently 0.550%) based on the Leverage Ratio. Interest is payable either quarterly or every one, three or six months, depending on which type of interest rate is selected by RLP. The 2021 Incremental Term Loan Facility allows for the Borrowers to receive annual patronage payments, which are profit distributions made by a cooperative to its member-users based on the quantity or value of business done with the member-user.Any advance made under the 2021 Incremental Term Loan Facility must be repaid by RLP on June 1, 2029 and may be prepaid by RLP without penalty (other than payment of customary breakage costs for payment of an advance accruing interest at the Eurodollar rate prior to the end of the interest period for such advance) at any time in whole or part.The 2021 Incremental Term Loan Facility will be subject to the covenants and events of default contained in the Credit Agreement dated as of August 5, 2015 among the Borrowers, the Lenders party thereto and the Administrative Agent (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement contains financial covenants related to leverage and interest coverage, as well as other affirmative and negative covenants relating to, among other things, dividends, liens, mergers, dispositions of timber and timberlands, subsidiary debt, sales and issuances of capital stock of subsidiaries, and affiliate transactions. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the Lenders holding more than 50% of the outstanding amount of the commitments and advances under the credit facilities thereunder may accelerate amounts due under the Credit Agreement (except in the case of a bankruptcy or insolvency event of default, in which case such amounts shall automatically become due and payable).Additionally, the Amendment Agreement, among other things, provides for the following:•an extension of the maturity date of the revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) from April 1, 2025 to June 1, 2026; and •modifications to adjust the pricing grid under the Credit Agreement to decrease the applicable margin for the Revolving Credit Facility and the 2016 incremental term loan facility by 25 basis points. Some of the Lenders and potential lenders under the Credit Agreement (and their respective subsidiaries or affiliates) have in the past provided, and may in the future provide, investment banking, underwriting, lending, commercial banking, trust and other advisory services to Rayonier and its subsidiaries and affiliates. These parties have received, and may in the future receive, customary compensation from Rayonier and its subsidiaries and affiliates for such services.1Table of ContentsFor additional information on the Credit Agreement and facilities thereunder, including the terms thereof, see Rayonier’s Current Reports on Form 8-K dated August 5, 2015, May 5, 2016, April 2, 2020 and April 17, 2020.

(“Rayonier”), Rayonier TRS Holdings Inc. (“TRS”), Rayonier Operating Company LLC (“ROC”) and Rayonier, L.P. (“RLP,” collectively with Rayonier, TRS and ROC, each individually a “Borrower” and collectively, the “Borrowers”) entered into a Fifth Amendment, Incremental Term Loan Agreement and Amendment to Guarantee Agreement (the “Amendment Agreement”) with the several banks, financial institutions and other institutional lenders party thereto (the “Lenders”) and COBANK, ACB, as administrative agent (the “Administrative Agent”), to amend certain terms of the Credit Agreement (as defined below) and to provide a senior unsecured incremental term loan facility to RLP in an aggregate amount of $250 million (the “2022 Incremental Term Loan Facility”) to be advanced by certain Lenders providing commitments under the 2022 Incremental Term Loan Facility, which RLP expects to use for general corporate purposes, including, if applicable, to finance acquisitions and refinance existing debt (including, in each case, fees and expenses in connection therewith).The periodic interest rate on the 2022 Incremental Term Loan Facility is based, at RLP’s option, on either (1) a Term SOFR or Daily Simple SOFR rate plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10% plus an applicable margin (currently 1.60%) based on the ratio of consolidated funded debt of Rayonier and its subsidiaries to the sum of the consolidated net worth of Rayonier and its subsidiaries plus the consolidated funded debt of Rayonier and its subsidiaries (the “Leverage Ratio”) or (2) the highest of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus ½ of 1.00%, and (c) the one-month Term SOFR rate plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10% plus 1.00%, plus an applicable margin (currently 0.60%) based on the Leverage Ratio. Interest is payable either monthly, quarterly or every one, three, or six months, depending on which type of interest rate is selected by RLP. The 2022 Incremental Term Loan Facility allows for the Borrowers to receive annual patronage payments, which are profit distributions made by a cooperative to its member-users based on the quantity or value of business done with the member-user. Additionally, the interest rates under the 2022 Incremental Term Loan Facility are to be automatically reset on the date that is two and one-half years into the term thereof (which reset may be an increase or decrease) based upon the difference between the cost of funds of the lenders at such time as compared to their cost of funds at the time the 2022 Incremental Term Loan Facility was initially funded similar to certain of the other term loan facilities under the Credit Agreement (as defined below).All advances made under the 2022 Incremental Term Loan Facility must be repaid by RLP on December 14, 2027. Advances made under the 2022 Incremental Term Loan Facility may be prepaid by RLP, without penalty (other than payment of customary breakage costs for payment of an advance accruing interest at the Term SOFR rate prior to the end of the interest period for such advance), at any time in whole or part.The 2022 Incremental Term Loan Facility will be subject to the covenants and events of default contained in that certain Credit Agreement entered into among the Borrowers, the Lenders party thereto and the Administrative Agent, dated as of August 5, 2015 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement contains financial covenants related to leverage and interest coverage, as well as other affirmative and negative covenants relating to, among other things, dividends, liens, mergers, dispositions of timber and timberlands, subsidiary debt, sales and issuances of capital stock of subsidiaries, and affiliate transactions. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the Lenders holding more than 50% of the outstanding amount of the commitments and advances under the credit facilities thereunder may accelerate amounts due under the Credit Agreement (except in the case of a bankruptcy or insolvency event of default, in which case such amounts shall automatically become due and payable).Additionally, the Amendment Agreement, among other things, replaces LIBOR as the benchmark for interest rates under the Credit Agreement with Term SOFR and/or Daily Simple SOFR (plus, in each case, a credit spread adjustment of 0.10%).Some of the Lenders and potential lenders under the Credit Agreement (and their respective subsidiaries or affiliates) have in the past provided, and may in the future provide, investment banking, underwriting, lending, commercial banking, trust and 1Table of Contentsother advisory services to Rayonier and its subsidiaries and affiliates. These parties have received, and may in the future receive, customary compensation from Rayonier and its subsidiaries and affiliates for such services.For additional information on the Credit Agreement and facilities thereunder, including the terms thereof, see Rayonier’s Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on August 5, 2015, May 2, 2016, April 2, 2020, April 17, 2020 and June 7, 2021.

In connection with the consummation of the Acquisitions, the parties entered into an amendment to one of the purchase agreements related to the Acquisitions, which resulted in a reduction of the total aggregate purchase price due to the removal of the leased timberlands from the transaction. The total aggregate purchase price paid by Rayonier for the Acquisitions is approximately $454 million, after customary purchase price adjustments at closing. Rayonier expects the Acquisitions to contribute an average annual harvest volume of approximately 725,000 tons and an average annual Adjusted EBITDA contribution from timberland operations of approximately $23 million over the next 10 years.  The Acquisitions were funded using cash on hand and the proceeds from incremental borrowings through the Farm Credit System. Borrowing rates on the 2022 Incremental Term Loan Facility are variable. Rayonier has entered into an interest rate swap agreement to fix $100 million of borrowings under the 2022 Incremental Term Loan Facility at an all-in effective cost of approximately 4.6%, net of estimated patronage refunds.

The Common Shares were issued pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) under Section 1145 of chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code and, to the extent such exemption was unavailable, in reliance on the exemption provided by section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act.

As of August 11, 2021 and based on information provided by the Company’s transfer agent, there were 10,167,855 Restricted Shares outstanding held by 199 holders of record. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company has filed a registration statement on Form S-1 (the “Registration Statement”) of the Securities Act registering the re-sale of certain Restricted Securities. Upon resale pursuant to the Registration Statement, Restricted Shares will no longer be restricted or bear a restrictive legend. Additionally, under the provisions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act (“Rule 144”), non-affiliates will be entitled to transfer or sell their Restricted Shares without restrictions as early as October 30, 2021.

(the “Company”) entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with eNett International (Jersey) Limited, a Jersey limited company (“eNett”), Optal Limited, a private company limited by shares incorporated in England and Wales (“Optal”), Travelport Limited, a Bermuda exempted company (“Travelport”), Toro Private Holdings I, Ltd., a private company limited by shares incorporated in England and Wales (“Toro”), Optal, in its capacity as trustee of the PSP Group DESOP Discretionary Trust established by way of discretionary trust deed dated 28 October 2008, as amended from time to time, and the other shareholders of eNett and Optal set forth therein (together with Travelport and Toro, the “Sellers”) under which the Company has agreed to purchase eNett and Optal from the Sellers (the “Acquisition”). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, at the closing of the Acquisition, the Company will acquire, directly and indirectly, all of the issued share capital of eNett and Optal from the Sellers, for an aggregate purchase price comprised of approximately $1.275 billion in cash and 2,002,450 shares of the Company’s common stock and subject to certain working capital and other adjustments as described in the Purchase Agreement.The parties’ obligations to consummate the Acquisition are subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. There is no financing condition to closing in the Purchase Agreement. The parties to the Purchase Agreement have each made customary warranties and covenants in the Purchase Agreement. Each of the Company, eNett or Optal may terminate the Purchase Agreement if (i) the closing has not occurred on or prior to October 24, 2020 (subject to extension if the marketing period in connection with the Company’s financing has commenced and not been completed), (ii) an order or law permanently preventing or prohibiting the Acquisition has become final and non-appealable, (iii) the other party has breached its warranties or covenants, subject to customary materiality qualifications and abilities to cure or (iv) any governmental entity has denied a regulatory approval required for closing and such denial has become final and non-appealable. In addition, eNett or Optal may also terminate the Purchase Agreement if, upon the satisfaction of the closing conditions and the expiration of the marketing period, the Company fails to consummate the Acquisition. Upon such a termination (and in certain other limited circumstances), the Company may be required to pay eNett and Optal cash termination fees in an aggregate amount of $51,000,000. In connection with the closing of the Acquisition, the Company and the Sellers have agreed that certain recipients of stock consideration shall enter into an investor rights agreement, which will, among other things, restrict the transfer of all shares of the Company’s common stock received by such Sellers in connection with the Acquisition for six months after the closing of the Acquisition, with half of those shares subject to transfer restrictions for an additional six months thereafter. Such Sellers will also receive customary registration rights with respect to their shares of the Company’s common stock.The foregoing description of the Purchase Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Purchase Agreement, a copy of which is being filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.The Purchase Agreement has been included to provide investors and security holders with information regarding its terms and such information is limited in nature to describing the parties’ agreement with regard to the Acquisition. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about the Company, eNett, Optal, the Sellers or their respective subsidiaries and affiliates. The Purchase Agreement contains warranties by the Company, on the one hand, and by eNett, Optal and the other Sellers, on the other hand, made solely for the benefit of the other. The assertions embodied in those warranties are qualified by information in confidential disclosure schedules delivered by each party in connection with the signing of the Purchase Agreement. Moreover, certain warranties in the Purchase Agreement were made as of a specified date, may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from what might be viewed as material to stockholders, or may have been used for the purpose of allocating risk between the Company, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand. Accordingly, the warranties in the Purchase Agreement should not be relied on by any persons as characterizations of the actual state of facts about the Company at the time they were made or otherwise. In addition, information concerning the subject matter of the warranties may change after the date of the Purchase Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Company’s public disclosures. The Purchase Agreement should not be read alone, but should instead be read in conjunction with the other information regarding the Purchase Agreement, the Acquisition, the Company, eNett, Optal, their respective affiliates and their respective businesses, that will be contained in, or incorporated by reference into, the Forms 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other filings that the Company makes with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).Commitment LetterIn connection with the Acquisition, the Company entered into a Commitment Letter, dated as of January 24, 2020 (the “Commitment Letter”), with Bank of America, N.A.

Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.On June 29, 2020, the Company announced it has agreed to issue and sell convertible notes in an aggregate principal amount of $310 million and $90 million in common stock to an affiliate of Warburg Pincus LLC through a private placement (the “Private Placement”). On June 29, 2020, the Company issued a press release announcing the Private Placement, the Second Amended and Restated Commitment Letter and the Ninth Amendment. A copy of that press release is filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.As previously disclosed, (i) the Company has concluded that the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and conditions arising in connection with it have had, and continue to have, a material adverse effect on the businesses of eNett and Optal, which is disproportionate to the effect on others in the relevant industry, (ii) the Company has advised eNett and Optal that it is not required to close the Acquisition because of this material adverse effect and (iii) the shareholders of eNett and the shareholders of Optal each initiated separate legal proceedings against the Company by filing claims in the High Court of Justice of England and Wales in the United Kingdom denying that there has been a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) and seeking, among other things, specific performance of the Company’s obligations under the Purchase Agreement. The Company intends to continue to vigorously defend against these claims, and there has been no change with respect to the Company’s position regarding its obligations under the Purchase Agreement, including its conclusion that a Material Adverse Effect has occurred and that it is not required to close the transaction.

It is the intention of the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series that the holders of First Lien Obligations of such Series (and not the First Lien Secured Parties of any other Series) bear the risk of (i) any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that (x) any of the First Lien Obligations of such Series are unenforceable under applicable law or are subordinated to any other obligations (other than another Series of First Lien Obligations), (y) any of the First Lien Obligations of such Series do not have an enforceable security interest in any of the Collateral securing any other Series of First Lien Obligations and/or (z) any intervening security interest exists securing any other obligations (other than another Series of First Lien Obligations) on a basis ranking prior to the security interest of such Series of First Lien Obligations but junior to the security interest of any other Series of First Lien Obligations or (ii) the existence of any Collateral for any other Series of First Lien Obligations that is not Shared Collateral for such Series (any such condition referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) with respect to any Series of First Lien Obligations, an “Impairment” of such Series). In the event of any Impairment with respect to any Series of First Lien Obligations, the results of such Impairment shall be borne solely by the holders of such Series of First Lien Obligations, and the rights of the holders of such Series of First Lien Obligations (including, without limitation, the right to receive distributions in respect of such Series of First Lien Obligations pursuant to Section 2.01) set forth herein shall be modified to the extent necessary so that the effects of such Impairment are borne solely by the holders of the Series of such First Lien Obligations subject to such Impairment. Additionally, in the event the First Lien Obligations of any Series are modified pursuant to applicable law (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code), any reference to such First Lien Obligations or the First Lien Documents governing such First Lien Obligations shall refer to such obligations or such documents as so modified.ARTICLE II  Priorities and Agreements with Respect to Shared CollateralSECTION 2.01 Priority of Claims. (a) Anything contained herein or in any of the Secured Credit Documents to the contrary notwithstanding (but subject to Section 1.03), if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and the Controlling Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Party is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Shared Collateral, or any distribution is made in respect of any Shared Collateral in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding of the Borrower (including any adequate protection payments) or any other Grantor or any First Lien Secured Party receives any payment pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than this Agreement) with respect to any Shared Collateral, the proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Shared Collateral by any Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Party, proceeds of any such distribution and any such payment (all such payments, distributions, and proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any Shared Collateral and all such payments and proceeds of any such distribution being collectively referred to as “Proceeds”), shall be applied (i) FIRST, to the payment of all amounts owing to each Collateral Agent (in its capacity as such) pursuant to the terms of any Secured Credit Document, (ii) SECOND, subject to Section 1.03, to the payment in full of the First Lien Obligations of each Series on a ratable basis, with such Proceeds to be applied to the First Lien Obligations of a given Series in accordance with the terms of the applicable Secured Credit Documents and (iii) THIRD, after the Discharge of all First Lien Obligations, to the Borrower and the other Grantors or their successors or assigns, as their interests may appear, or to whosoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct; provided that following the commencement of any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding with respect to any Grantor, solely for purposes of this Section 2.01(a) and not for the purposes of the Credit Agreement or any Additional First Lien Documents, in the event the value of the Shared Collateral is not sufficient for the entire amount of Post-Petition Interest on the First Lien Obligations to be allowed under Sections 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other Bankruptcy Law in such Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, the amount of First Lien Obligations of each Series of First Lien Obligations shall include only the maximum amount of Post-Petition Interest allowable under Sections 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other Bankruptcy Law in such Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Shared Collateral for which a third party (other than a First Lien Secured Party) has a lien or security interest that is junior in priority to the security interest of any Series of First Lien Obligations, but senior (as determined by appropriate legal proceedings in the case of any dispute) to the security interest of any other Series of First Lien Obligations (such third party an “Intervening Creditor”), the value of any Shared Collateral or Proceeds which are allocated to such Intervening Creditor shall be deducted on a ratable basis solely from the Shared Collateral or Proceeds to be distributed in respect of the Series of First Lien Obligations with respect to which such Impairment exists. If, despite the provisions of this Section 2.01(a), any First Lien Secured Party shall receive any payment or other recovery in excess of its portion of payments on account of the First Lien Obligations to which it is then entitled in accordance with this Section 2.01(a), such First Lien Secured Party shall hold such payment or recovery in trust for the benefit of all First Lien Secured Parties for distribution in accordance with this Section 2.01(a).(b) It is acknowledged that the First Lien Obligations of any Series may, subject to the limitations set forth in the then extant Secured Credit Documents, be increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded, Refinanced or otherwise amended or modified from time to time, all without affecting the priorities set forth in Section 2.01(a) or the provisions of this Agreement defining the relative rights of the First Lien Secured Parties of any Series.(c) Notwithstanding the date, time, method, manner or order of grant, attachment or perfection of any Liens securing any Series of First Lien Obligations granted on the Shared Collateral and notwithstanding any provision of the Uniform Commercial Code of any jurisdiction, or any other applicable law or the Secured Credit Documents or any defect or deficiencies in the Liens securing the First Lien Obligations of any Series or any other circumstance whatsoever (but, in each case, subject to Section 1.03 and the penultimate sentence of Section 2.01(a)), each First Lien Secured Party hereby agrees that (i) the Liens securing each Series of First Lien Obligations on any Shared Collateral shall be of equal priority and (ii) the benefits and proceeds of the Shared Collateral shall be shared among the First Lien Secured Parties as provided herein.(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any other First Lien Security Documents to the contrary, Collateral consisting of cash and cash equivalents pledged to secure Credit Agreement Obligations consisting of reimbursement obligations in respect of Letters of Credit or otherwise held by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(g) of the Credit Agreement (or any equivalent successor provision) shall be applied as specified in such Section of the Credit Agreement and will not constitute Shared Collateral.SECTION 2.02 Actions with Respect to Shared Collateral; Prohibition on Contesting Liens. (a) With respect to any Shared Collateral, (i) only the Controlling Collateral Agent shall act or refrain from acting with respect to the Shared Collateral (including with respect to any intercreditor agreement with respect to any Shared Collateral) and (ii) no Non-Controlling Collateral Agent or other Non-Controlling Secured Party shall or shall instruct the Controlling Collateral Agent to, commence any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its security interest in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, any Shared Collateral (including with respect to any intercreditor agreement with respect to any Shared Collateral), whether under any First Lien Security Document, applicable law or otherwise, it being agreed that only the Controlling Collateral Agent shall be entitled to take any such actions or exercise any such remedies with respect to Shared Collateral; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, any Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party may file a proof of claim or statement of interest with respect to the First Lien Obligations owed to the First Lien Secured Parties; (ii) any Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party may take any action to preserve or protect the validity and enforceability of the Liens granted in favor of First Lien Secured Parties, provided that no such action is, or could reasonably be expected to be, (A) adverse to the Liens granted in favor of the Controlling Secured Parties or the rights of the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other Controlling Secured Parties to exercise remedies in respect thereof or (B) otherwise inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement; and (iii) any Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party may file any responsive or defensive pleadings in opposition to any motion, claim, adversary proceeding or other pleading made by any Person objecting to or otherwise seeking the disallowance of the claims or Liens of such First Lien Secured Party, including any claims secured by the Shared Collateral, in each case, to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens on the Shared Collateral, the Controlling Collateral Agent may deal with the Shared Collateral as if such Controlling Collateral Agent had a senior Lien on such Collateral. No Non-Controlling Collateral Agent or Non-Controlling Secured Party will contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Controlling Collateral Agent or Controlling Secured Party or any other exercise by the Controlling Collateral Agent or Controlling Secured Party of any rights and remedies relating to the Shared Collateral. The foregoing shall not be construed to limit the rights and priorities of any First Lien Secured Party or Collateral Agent with respect to any Collateral not constituting Shared Collateral.(b) Each Collateral Agent and the First Lien Secured Parties for which it is acting hereunder agree to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement.(c) Each of the First Lien Secured Parties agrees that it will not (and hereby waives any right to) contest or support any other Person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity, attachment or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the First Lien Secured Parties in all or any part of the Collateral, the allowability of any claims asserted with respect thereto or the provisions of this Agreement; provided that nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent or impair the rights of any Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party to enforce this Agreement.SECTION 2.03 No Interference; Payment Over. (a) Each First Lien Secured Party agrees that (i) it will not challenge, or support any other Person in challenging, in any proceeding (including any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding) the validity or enforceability of any First Lien Obligations of any Series or any First Lien Security Document or the validity, attachment, perfection or priority of any Lien under any First Lien Security Document or the allowability of any claims asserted with respect thereto, or the validity or enforceability of the priorities, rights or duties established by or other provisions of this Agreement; (ii) it will not take or cause to be taken any action the purpose or intent of which is, or could be, to interfere, hinder or delay, in any manner, whether by judicial proceedings or otherwise, any sale, transfer or other disposition of the Shared Collateral by the Controlling Collateral Agent; (iii) it will not institute in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or other proceeding any claim against the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Shared Collateral, and none of the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Controlling Collateral Agent or other First Lien Secured Party with respect to any Shared Collateral in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement; (iv) it will not seek, and hereby waives any right, to have any Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral; and (v) it will not attempt, directly or indirectly, whether by judicial proceedings or otherwise, to challenge the enforceability of any provision of this Agreement; provided that nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent or impair the rights of any Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party to enforce this Agreement.(b) Each First Lien Secured Party hereby agrees that if it shall obtain possession of any Shared Collateral or shall realize any proceeds or payment in respect of any such Shared Collateral, pursuant to any First Lien Security Document or by the exercise of any rights available to it under applicable law or in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or through any other exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement), at any time prior to the Discharge of each of the First Lien Obligations, then it shall hold such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other First Lien Secured Parties that have a security interest in such Shared Collateral and promptly transfer such Shared Collateral, Proceeds or payment, as the case may be, to the Controlling Collateral Agent, to be distributed in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.01 hereof.SECTION 2.04 Automatic Release of Liens; Amendments to First Lien Security Documents. (a) If, at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any Shared Collateral resulting in a sale or disposition thereof, then (whether or not any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding is pending at the time) the Liens in favor of each Collateral Agent for the benefit of each Series of First Lien Secured Parties upon such Shared Collateral will automatically be released and discharged; provided that any proceeds of any Shared Collateral realized therefrom shall be applied pursuant to Section 2.01 hereof.(b) Each First Lien Secured Party agrees that each Collateral Agent may enter into any amendment to any First Lien Security Document that does not violate this Agreement.(c) Each Collateral Agent agrees to execute and deliver (at the sole cost and expense of the Grantors) all such authorizations and other instruments as shall reasonably be requested by the Controlling Collateral Agent to evidence and confirm any release of Shared Collateral provided for in this Section.SECTION 2.05. Certain Agreements with Respect to Bankruptcy or Insolvency Proceedings. (a) This Agreement shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the commencement of any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or any other Bankruptcy Law or similar law by or against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.(b) If the Borrower and/or any other Grantor shall become subject to an Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding and shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of financing (“DIP Financing”) to be provided by one or more lenders (the “DIP Lenders”) under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or any equivalent provision of any other Bankruptcy Law and/or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code or any equivalent provision of any other Bankruptcy Law, each First Lien Secured Party agrees that it will raise no objection to any such financing or to the Liens on the Shared Collateral securing the same (“DIP Financing Liens”) and/or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes Shared Collateral unless the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Controlling Secured Party, shall then oppose or object to such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens and/or use of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Shared Collateral for the benefit of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will subordinate its Liens with respect to such Shared Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens rank pari passu with the Liens on any such Shared Collateral granted to secure the First Lien Obligations of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will confirm the priorities with respect to such Shared Collateral as set forth herein), in each case so long as (A) the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series retain the benefit of their Liens on all such Shared Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof arising after the commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority vis-a-vis all the other First Lien Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the commencement of such Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, (B) the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series are granted Liens on any additional collateral pledged to any First Lien Secured Parties as adequate protection or otherwise in connection with such DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral, with the same priority vis-a-vis the First Lien Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as set forth in this Agreement, (C) if any amount of such DIP Financing and/or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the First Lien Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to Section 2.01 of this Agreement, and (D) if any First Lien Secured Parties are granted adequate protection with respect to First Lien Obligations subject hereto, including in the form of periodic payments, in connection with such DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral, the proceeds of such adequate protection are applied pursuant to Section 2.01 of this Agreement; provided that the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series shall have a right to object to the grant of a Lien to secure the DIP Financing over any Collateral subject to Liens in favor of the First Lien Secured Parties of such Series or its Collateral Agent that shall not constitute Shared Collateral; and provided, further, that the First Lien Secured Parties receiving adequate protection shall not object to any other First Lien Secured Party receiving adequate protection comparable to any adequate protection granted to such First Lien Secured Parties in connection with a DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral.SECTION 2.06. Reinstatement. In the event that any of the First Lien Obligations shall be paid in full and such payment or any part thereof shall subsequently, for whatever reason (including an order or judgment for disgorgement or avoidance of a preference or fraudulent transfer, under the Bankruptcy Code, any Bankruptcy Law or any similar law, or the settlement of any claim in respect thereof), be required to be returned or repaid, the terms and conditions of this Article II shall be fully applicable thereto until all such First Lien Obligations shall again have been paid in full in cash.SECTION 2.07. Insurance. As between the First Lien Secured Parties, the Controlling Collateral Agent shall have the right to adjust or settle any insurance policy or claim covering or constituting Shared Collateral in the event of any loss thereunder and to approve any award granted in any condemnation or similar proceeding affecting the Shared Collateral.SECTION 2.08. Refinancings. The First Lien Obligations of any Series may be Refinanced, in whole or in part, in each case, without notice to, or the consent (except to the extent a consent is otherwise required to permit the Refinancing transaction under any Secured Credit Document) of any First Lien Secured Party of any other Series, all without affecting the priorities provided for herein or the other provisions hereof; provided that the Collateral Agent of the holders of any such Refinancing indebtedness shall have executed a Joinder Agreement on behalf of the holders of such Refinancing indebtedness.SECTION 2.09. Possessory Collateral Agent as Gratuitous Bailee for Perfection. (a) The Controlling Collateral Agent agrees to hold any Shared Collateral constituting Possessory Collateral that is part of the Shared Collateral in its possession or control (or in the possession or control of its agents or bailees) as gratuitous bailee for the benefit of each other First Lien Secured Party and any assignee solely for the purpose of perfecting the security interest granted in such Possessory Collateral, if any, pursuant to the applicable First Lien Security Documents, in each case, subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 2.09; provided that at any time after the Discharge of the First Lien Obligations of the Series for which the Controlling Collateral Agent is acting, the Controlling Collateral Agent shall (at the sole cost and expense of the Grantors), promptly deliver all Possessory Collateral to the Controlling Collateral Agent (after giving effect to the Discharge of such First Lien Obligations) together with any necessary endorsements reasonably requested by the Controlling Collateral Agent (or make such other arrangements as shall be reasonably requested by the Controlling Collateral Agent to allow the Controlling Collateral Agent to obtain control of such Possessory Collateral). Pending delivery to the Controlling Collateral Agent, each other Collateral Agent agrees to hold any Shared Collateral constituting Possessory Collateral, from time to time in its possession, as gratuitous bailee for the benefit of each other First Lien Secured Party and any assignee, solely for the purpose of perfecting the security interest granted in such Possessory Collateral, if any, pursuant to the applicable First Lien Security Documents, in each case, subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 2.09.(b) The duties or responsibilities of the Controlling Collateral Agent and each other Collateral Agent under this Section 2.09 shall be limited solely to holding any Shared Collateral constituting Possessory Collateral as gratuitous bailee for the benefit of each other First Lien Secured Party for purposes of perfecting the Lien held by such First Lien Secured Parties therein.ARTICLE III  Existence and Amounts of Liens and ObligationsSECTION 3.01. Determinations with Respect to Amounts of Liens and Obligations. Whenever any Collateral Agent shall be required, in connection with the exercise of its rights or the performance of its obligations hereunder, to determine the existence or amount of any First Lien Obligations of any Series, or the Shared Collateral subject to any Lien securing the First Lien Obligations of any Series, it may request that such information be furnished to it in writing by each other Collateral Agent and shall be entitled to make such determination on the basis of the information so furnished; provided, however, that if any Collateral Agent shall fail or refuse reasonably promptly to provide the requested information, the requesting Collateral Agent shall be entitled to make any such determination by such method as it may, in the exercise of its good faith judgment, determine, including by reliance upon a certificate of the Borrower. Each Collateral Agent may rely conclusively, and shall be fully protected in so relying, on any determination made by it in accordance with the provisions of the preceding sentence (or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction) and shall have no liability to any Grantor, any First Lien Secured Party or any other Person as a result of such determination.ARTICLE IV  The Controlling Collateral AgentSECTION 4.01. Appointment and Authority. (a) Each of the First Lien Secured Parties hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Controlling Collateral Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Controlling Collateral Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto. In this connection, the Controlling Collateral Agent and any co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact appointed by the Controlling Collateral Agent pursuant to the applicable Senior Credit Documents for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof) granted under any of the First Lien Security Documents, or for exercising any rights and remedies thereunder at the direction of the Controlling Collateral Agent, shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of this Article IV and Article IX of the Credit Agreement and the equivalent provision of any Initial Additional First Lien Document and any Additional First Lien Document (as though such co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact were the “Collateral Agent” named therein) as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto. Without limiting the foregoing, each of the First Lien Secured Parties, and each Collateral Agent, hereby agrees to provide such cooperation and assistance as may be reasonably requested by the Controlling Collateral Agent to facilitate and effect actions taken or intended to be taken by the Controlling Collateral Agent pursuant to this Article IV, such cooperation to include execution and delivery of notices, instruments and other documents as are reasonably deemed necessary by the Controlling Collateral Agent to effect such actions, and joining in any action, motion or proceeding initiated by the Controlling Collateral Agent for such purposes.(b) Each Non-Controlling Secured Party acknowledges and agrees that the Controlling Collateral Agent shall be entitled, for the benefit of the First Lien Secured Parties, to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of or deal with any Shared Collateral as provided herein and in the First Lien Security Documents, without regard to any rights to which the holders of the Non-Controlling Secured Obligations would otherwise be entitled as a result of such Non-Controlling Secured Obligations. Without limiting the foregoing, each Non-Controlling Secured Party agrees that none of the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party shall have any duty or obligation first to marshal or realize upon any type of Shared Collateral (or any other Collateral securing any of the First Lien Obligations), or to sell, dispose of or otherwise liquidate all or any portion of such Shared Collateral (or any other Collateral securing any First Lien Obligations), in any manner that would maximize the return to the Non-Controlling Secured Parties, notwithstanding that the order and timing of any such realization, sale, disposition or liquidation may affect the amount of proceeds actually received by the Non-Controlling Secured Parties from such realization, sale, disposition or liquidation. Each of the First Lien Secured Parties waives any claim it may now or hereafter have against the Controlling Collateral Agent or the Collateral Agent for any other Series of First Lien Obligations or any other First Lien Secured Party of any other Series arising out of (i) any actions that do not violate this Agreement which any Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Party takes or omits to take (including, actions with respect to the creation, perfection or continuation of Liens on any Collateral, actions with respect to the foreclosure upon, sale, release or depreciation of, or failure to realize upon, any of the Collateral and actions with respect to the collection of any claim for all or any part of the First Lien Obligations from any account debtor, guarantor or any other party) in accordance with the First Lien Security Documents or any other agreement related thereto or to the collection of the First Lien Obligations or the valuation, use, protection or release of any security for the First Lien Obligations, (ii) any election by any Collateral Agent or any holders of First Lien Obligations, in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding of the application of Section 1111(b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any equivalent provision of any other Bankruptcy Law or (iii) subject to Section 2.05, any borrowing by, or grant of a security interest or administrative expense priority under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or any equivalent provision of any other Bankruptcy Law by, any Grantor or any of its Subsidiaries, as debtor-in-possession.SECTION 4.02. Rights as a First Lien Secured Party. (a) The Person serving as the Controlling Collateral Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a First Lien Secured Party under any Series of First Lien Obligations that it holds as any other First Lien Secured Party of such Series and may exercise the same as though it were not the Controlling Collateral Agent and the term “First Lien Secured Party” or “First Lien Secured Parties” or (as applicable) “Credit Agreement Secured Party”, “Credit Agreement Secured Parties,” “Initial Additional First Lien Secured Party,” “Initial Additional First Lien Secured Parties,” “Additional First Lien Secured Party” or “Additional First Lien Secured Parties” shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Controlling Collateral Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Grantors or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Controlling Collateral Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to any other First Lien Secured Party.SECTION 4.03. Exculpatory Provisions. The Controlling Collateral Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Controlling Collateral Agent:(i) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;(ii) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby; provided that the Controlling Collateral Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Controlling Collateral Agent to liability or that is contrary to this Agreement or applicable law;(iii) shall not, except as expressly set forth herein, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to a Grantor or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Controlling Collateral Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity;(iv) shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (1) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct or (2) in reliance on a certificate of an authorized officer of the Borrower stating that such action is permitted by the terms of this Agreement. The Controlling Collateral Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Event of Default under any Series of First Lien Obligations unless and until notice describing such Event Default and referencing applicable agreement is given to the Controlling Collateral Agent;(v) shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (1) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other First Lien Security Document, (2) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (3) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, (4) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other First Lien Security Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or the creation, perfection or priority of any Lien purported to be created by the First Lien Security Documents, (5) the value or the sufficiency of any Collateral for any Series of First Lien Obligations, or (6) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in any Secured Credit Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Controlling Collateral Agent; and(vi) need not segregate money held hereunder from other funds except to the extent required by law. The Controlling Collateral Agent shall be under no liability for interest on any money received by it hereunder except as otherwise agreed in writing.SECTION 4.04. Collateral and Guaranty Matters.  Each of the First Lien Secured Parties irrevocably authorizes the applicable Collateral Agent, at its option and in its discretion, to release any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Collateral Agent under any First Lien Security Document in accordance with Section 2.04 or upon receipt of a written request from the Borrower stating that the releases of such Lien is permitted by the terms of each then extant Secured Credit Document.ARTICLE V  MiscellaneousSECTION 5.01.

Waivers; Amendment; Joinder Agreements. (a) No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the parties hereto are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by any party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No notice or demand on any party hereto in any case shall entitle such party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.(b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be terminated, waived, amended or modified (other than pursuant to any Joinder Agreement) except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by each Collateral Agent (and with respect to any such termination, waiver, amendment or modification which by the terms of this Agreement requires the Borrower’s consent or which increases the obligations or reduces the rights of the Borrower or any other Grantor, with the consent of the Borrower).(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any First Lien Secured Party, any Additional Agent may become a party hereto by execution and delivery of a Joinder Agreement in accordance with Section 5.13 of this Agreement and upon such execution and delivery, such Additional Agent and the Additional First Lien Secured Parties and Additional First Lien Obligations of the Series for which such Additional Agent is acting shall be subject to the terms hereof.(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any other Collateral Agent or First Lien Secured Party, the Controlling Collateral Agent may effect amendments and modifications to this Agreement to the extent necessary to reflect any incurrence of any Additional First Lien Obligations in compliance with the Credit Agreement, any Initial Additional First Lien Documents and any Additional First Lien Documents.SECTION 5.03.
