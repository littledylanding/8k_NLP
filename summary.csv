Reconciliations of these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures are not included in the Press Release furnished herewith due to the high variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections of some of the excluded information, together with some of the excluded information not being ascertainable or accessible at this time.

Rebalancing the Classes of Board of Directors  Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Code of Regulations (the “Code”) of Designer Brands Inc. (the “Company”), the members of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) are divided into three classes, with each class to consist, as nearly as possible, of one-third of the total authorized number of directors. Until November 17, 2022, the Board had two Class I directors, four Class II directors, and three Class III directors, with a vacancy for a fourth director in Class III. Following the rebalancing described below and the appointment of two new directors, also as described below, the Board has four Class I directors, four Class II directors, and three Class III directors.  For the Board to consist of three classes with directors divided as evenly as possible among the classes, on November 17, 2022, the Board eliminated the existing vacancy for a fourth director in Class III and expanded Class I to create a vacancy for a third director in Class I. Immediately following such actions, Peter Cobb, a Class II member of the Board at that time, tendered his resignation as a Class II director, and the Board immediately thereafter re-elected him as a Class I director on such date. All such actions, including Mr. Cobb’s resignation and re-election to the Board, were taken solely to ensure that the directors on the Board are divided as evenly as possible among the Board’s three classes. For all other purposes, Mr. Cobb’s service on the Board is deemed to have continued, uninterrupted and without any break in service, since the date that Mr. Cobb first joined the Board. There are no arrangements or understandings between Mr. Cobb and any other persons pursuant to which Mr. Cobb was re-elected to the Board as a director. Mr. Cobb will continue to serve as a member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance, Compensation, and Technology Committees of the Board and will continue to serve as chairperson of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board. Additionally, there were no changes to Mr. Cobb’s compensation for service as a non-employee director on the Board. Mr. Cobb will continue to receive the same benefits and the same compensation as other non-employee directors on the Board pursuant to the Company’s non-employee director compensation policy. The Company’s non-employee director compensation policy is described on pages 61-62 of the Company’s definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 5, 2022, except that the Company’s non-employee director compensation policy has been subsequently amended to, among other things, increase the annual Board retainer from $75,000 to $90,000, increase the annual equity grant from $140,000 to $150,000, and increase the annual chairperson retainers by $5,000 such that the annual Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee chairperson retainer was increased from $25,000 to $30,000 (the Company’s non-employee director compensation policy, as amended, is referred to herein as the “Non-Employee Director Compensation Policy”). Appointment of New Directors On November 17, 2022, the Board increased the authorized number of directors constituting the Board from ten to eleven and designated the newly created vacant director position as Class I, all in accordance with and as permitted by the Code. On November 17, 2022, the Board appointed Rich Paul as a Class II director of the Board and Tami Fersko as a Class I director of the Board, with each such appointment effective immediately. As a Class II director, Mr. Paul will serve until the Company’s 2024 annual meeting of shareholders and until his successor is duly elected and qualified, and as a Class I director, Ms. Fersko will serve until the Company’s 2023 annual meeting of shareholders and until her successor is duly elected and qualified. Additionally, Ms. Fersko was appointed to serve as a member of the Board’s Audit Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.Mr. Paul, 41, is the CEO and founder of KLUTCH Sports Group, an agency representing some of the biggest athletes across major professional sports. Ms. Fersko, 52, currently serves as the Chief Operations and Supply Chain Officer for Centric Brands, a global leading lifestyle brand collective. Mr. Paul and Ms. Fersko will each receive the same benefits and the same compensation as other non-employee directors on the Board pursuant to the Non-Employee Director Compensation Policy. In connection with their appointments to the Board, each of Mr. Paul and Ms. Fersko will each receive an initial award of restricted stock units with an aggregate fair value of $81,000, representing a pro-rata portion of the annual equity grant to non-employee directors. In addition, the Company will enter into its standard form of indemnification agreement with Mr. Paul and Ms. Fersko. The Board has determined that Mr. Paul and Ms. Fersko are independent for purposes of serving on the Board. There are no arrangements or understandings between either Mr. Paul or Ms. Fersko and any other persons pursuant to which they were appointed as directors. There are no family relationships between Mr. Paul or Ms. Fersko and any director or executive officer of the Company, and the Company has not entered into any transactions with either Mr. Paul or Ms. Fersko that would require disclosure under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.A copy of the Company’s press release announcing the appointment of Mr. Paul and Ms. Fersko to the Board has been furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.The information in this report furnished pursuant to Item 7.01, including Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto, shall not be deemed “filed” for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section.

Results of Operations and Financial Condition. On August 1, 2022, Enhabit, Inc. (“Enhabit” or the “Company”) issued a press release reporting the financial results of the Company for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022. A copy of the press release is attached to this report as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.The Company uses “same-store” comparisons to explain the changes in certain performance metrics and line items within its financial statements. Same-store comparisons are calculated based on home health and hospice locations open throughout both the full current period and the immediately prior period presented. These comparisons include the financial results of market consolidation transactions in existing markets, as it is difficult to determine, with precision, the incremental impact of these transactions on the Company’s results of operations.ITEM 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.See Item 2.02, “Results of Operations and Financial Condition,” above.In addition, a copy of the supplemental information which will be discussed during the Company’s earnings call at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, August 2, 2022 is attached to this report as Exhibit 99.2 and incorporated herein by reference.Note Regarding Presentation of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe financial data contained in the press release and supplemental information include “non-GAAP financial measures” as defined in Regulation G of the Exchange Act, including the Company’s adjusted earnings per share, leverage ratio, Adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted free cash flow.The Company is providing adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Enhabit (“Adjusted EPS”). The Company believes the presentation of Adjusted EPS provides useful additional information to investors because it provides better comparability of ongoing operating performance to prior periods given that it excludes the impact of government, class action, and related settlements; professional fees—accounting, tax, and legal; gains or losses related to hedging and equity instruments; loss on early extinguishment of debt; adjustments to its income tax provision (such as valuation allowance adjustments and settlements of income tax claims); items related to corporate and facility restructurings; and certain other items the Company believes to be non-indicative of its ongoing operating performance. It is reasonable to expect that one or more of these excluded items will occur in future periods, but the amounts recognized can vary significantly from period to period and may not directly relate to the Company’s ongoing operating performance. Accordingly, they can complicate comparisons of the Company’s results of operations across periods and comparisons of the Company’s results to those of other healthcare companies. Adjusted EPS should not be considered as a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) as the items excluded from it are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Because Adjusted EPS is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, it may not be comparable as presented to other similarly titled measures of other companies. The Company reconciles Adjusted EPS to earnings per share in the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 and the supplemental information attached as Exhibit 99.2. The leverage ratio referenced therein is defined as the ratio of consolidated total debt to Adjusted EBITDA for the trailing four quarters. The Company believes its leverage ratio and Adjusted EBITDA are measures of its ability to service its debt and its ability to make capital expenditures. Additionally, the leverage ratio is a standard measurement used by investors to gauge the creditworthiness of an institution. The Company’s credit agreement also includes a maximum leverage ratio financial covenant which allows the Company to deduct up to $200 million of cash on hand from consolidated total debt. The Company reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to net income and to net cash provided by operating activities in the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 and the supplemental information attached as Exhibit 99.2.The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis as a liquidity measure. The Company believes this financial measure on a consolidated basis is important in analyzing its liquidity because it is the key component of certain material covenants contained within the Company’s credit agreement, which is discussed in more detail in the Company’s Form 10 Registration Statement filed on May 25, 2022, as amended on June 9, 2022 and June 14, 2022. These covenants are material terms of the credit agreement. Noncompliance with these financial covenants under the credit agreement—its interest coverage ratio and its leverage ratio—could result in the Company’s lenders requiring the Company to immediately repay all amounts borrowed. If the Company anticipated a potential covenant violation, it would seek relief from its lenders, which would have some cost to the Company, and such relief might be on terms less favorable to those in the Company’s existing credit agreement. In addition, if the Company cannot satisfy these financial covenants, it would be prohibited under the credit agreement from engaging in certain activities, such as incurring additional indebtedness, paying common stock dividends, making certain payments, and acquiring and disposing of assets. Consequently, Adjusted EBITDA is critical to the Company’s assessment of its liquidity.In general terms, the credit agreement definition of Adjusted EBITDA, therein referred to as “Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA,” allows the Company to add back to consolidated net income interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization and then add back to consolidated net income (1) share-based compensation expense and (2) any “run rate” cost savings, operating expense reductions and synergies related to any acquisitions, dispositions and other specified transactions, restructurings, cost savings initiatives and other initiatives that are reasonably quantifiable not in excess of 25% of Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA. The Company also subtracts from consolidated net income all unusual or nonrecurring items to the extent they increase consolidated net income.Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP, and the items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net income or cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.The Company also uses adjusted free cash flow as an analytical indicator to assess its performance. Management believes the presentation of adjusted free cash flow provides investors an efficient means by which they can evaluate the Company’s capacity to reduce debt, pursue development activities, and return capital to its common stockholders. The calculation of adjusted free cash flow and a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to adjusted free cash flow are included in the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 and the supplemental information attached as Exhibit 99.2. This measure is not a defined measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities. The Company’s definition of adjusted free cash flow is limited and does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary spending. Because this measure is not determined in accordance with GAAP and is susceptible to varying calculations, it may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other companies. See the consolidated statements of cash flows included in the Company’s Form 10 Registration Statement filed on May 25, 2022, as amended on June 9, 2022 and June 14, 2022, and the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows included in the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2022 (the “June 2022 Form 10-Q”), when filed, and in the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 for the GAAP measures of cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities.Forward-Looking StatementsThe information contained herein and in the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto, and supplemental information, attached as Exhibit 99.2 hereto, include certain estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve known and unknown risks and relate to, among other things, future events, projections, financial guidance, legislative or regulatory developments, strategy or growth opportunities. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “targets,” “potential,” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements are based on assumptions the Company believes, as of the date hereof, are reasonable. Inevitably, there will be differences between such estimates and actual results, and those differences may be material.There can be no assurance that any estimates, projections, or forward-looking statements will be realized.All such estimates, projections, and forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof. The Company undertakes no duty to publicly update or revise such forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements in this report, the press release, and supplemental information as they are based on current expectations and general assumptions and are subject to various risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including those set forth in the attached press release, supplemental information, and in the Company’s Form 10 Registration Statement filed on May 25, 2022, as amended on June 9, 2022 and June 14, 2022, the June 2022 Form 10-Q when filed, and in other documents the Company previously filed with the SEC, many of which are beyond the Company’s control.

A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.01 to this report and is incorporated herein by reference.Item 2.05. Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities On October 25, 2022, FormFactor adopted restructuring plans to align FormFactor's cost structure with reduced demand levels within the Probe Cards segment by streamlining and improving the efficiency and business effectiveness of our operations. The plans include lowering headcount by approximately 13% of our workforce, which is expected to result in FormFactor recording restructuring charges of approximately $6.6 million in cash, consisting of severance and employee-related costs. We expect the actions defined under this plan will be largely completed by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. The financial impact of the action is expected to reduce the Company’s cost structure by approximately $25 to $30 million on an annualized basis once the actions are fully implemented. Item 9.01.

40,40,6030.0,HOUS,0001398987-19-000193,2019-08-28,"Item8.01.Other Events.On August 28, 2019, Realogy Holdings Corp. (the “Company” or “Realogy”) announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Cartus Corporation (“Cartus”), is launching a military rewards program that will offer U.S. military personnel, veterans and their families residential real estate brokerage services. The Cartus program, expected to become effective on September 7, 2019, will seek to provide access to benefits similar to those offered under the USAA Real Estate Rewards Network program, an affinity program between Cartus and the United Services Automobile Association (“USAA”). USAA is discontinuing the USAA Real Estate Rewards Network in order to shift focus to its core mortgage, banking and insurance businesses at this time.The USAA Real Estate Rewards Network program will remain open for enrollment through September 6, 2019. USAA members who enroll by that date will remain eligible for standard reward payments for qualifying transactions. Cartus, who has a long-trusted relationship with USAA, will make its new military rewards program available for qualified participants after September 6, 2019.Leads generated by the USAA affinity program have been handled by the Cartus Broker Network, a network of real estate brokers from the Company’s company owned brokerage operations, select Company franchisees and certain independent real estate brokers who receive referrals from Cartus’ high-quality lead generation programs under its relocation and affinity businesses. The Cartus Broker Network closed approximately 80,000 homesale transactions for Realogy and its brands in 2018 and approximately 36,000 such closings for the six months ended June 30, 2019 (which we refer to in this report as “in-network homesale transactions”). The Cartus affinity business is highly-concentrated and the USAA program represented a significant portion of this business and the in-network homesale transactions for Realogy and its brands. The discontinuation of the USAA program is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s financial results for the year ending December 31, 2019. The Company currently expects that in 2020, the USAA program discontinuation will likely have a material impact on earnings at Cartus and will result in a reduction in in-network homesale transactions for Realogy and its brands. The foregoing does not take into account potential positive offsets driven by the Company’s other existing and new affinity and lead generation programs, macro-economic changes, cost-savings initiatives and other management actions. Forward-Looking StatementsCertain statements in this Current Report on Form 8-K constitute “forward-looking statements.” Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, including statements related to the Cartus military rewards program and the Company’s financial results for 2019 and 2020. Statements preceded by, followed by or that otherwise include the words “believes”, “expects”, “forecasts”, “anticipates”, “intends”, “projects”, “estimates”, “potential” and “plans” and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as “will”, “should”, “would”, “may” and “could” are generally forward-looking in nature and not historical facts. Any statements that refer to expectations or other characterizations of future events, circumstances or results are forward-looking statements.Various factors that could cause actual future results and other future events to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to risks relating to the loss of a significant affinity client, including the discontinuance of the USAA affinity program, the expected launch of the Cartus military rewards program, and the corresponding impact on the Company’s revenues (including revenue to Cartus, NRT and RFG derived from Cartus referrals) and profitability, which may be material and adverse, as well as those set forth under the headings “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019 and its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, and its other filings made from time to time, in connection with considering any forward-looking statements that may be made by the Company and its businesses generally. The Company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements, to report events or to report the occurrence of unanticipated events except as required by law.Item 9.01.Financial Statements and Exhibits.

Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income, and adjusted EPS exclude certain non-cash and other specified charges. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to help investors more completely understand its past financial performance and prospects for the future. However, the presentation of adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income, adjusted EPS, and free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. Management believes the adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income, adjusted EPS, and free cash flow financial measures assist in providing a more complete understanding of the Company’s underlying operational results and trends, and management uses these measures along with the corresponding GAAP financial measures to manage the Company’s business, to evaluate its performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace, and to establish operational goals.

(“Northern”) issued a press release that it plans to undertake a reverse stock split of its common stock at a ratio ranging from any whole number between 1-for-6 to 1-for-10, as determined by Northern’s Board of Directors, and a reduction in the number of authorized shares of Northern’s common stock as set forth in the chart below based on the reverse stock split ratio that is selected.  RatioNumber of Shares of Common Stock Authorized1:6225,000,0001:7192,857,1431:8168,750,0001:9150,000,0001:10135,000,000The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.The reverse stock split will reduce the number of Northern shares of common stock outstanding and is expected to increase the per share trading price of Northern’s common stock, which may improve marketability and facilitate its trading.When the reverse stock split becomes effective, each number of shares between six to ten (depending on the reverse stock split ratio selected by Northern’s Board of Directors) shares of Northern’s common stock will automatically be converted into one share of common stock. Northern does not anticipate issuing fractional shares as a result of the reverse stock split; stockholders entitled to receive fractional shares as a result of the reverse stock split will receive cash payments in lieu of such shares.The reverse stock split and authorized share reduction will not change the proportionate equity interests or voting rights of holders of common stock, subject to the treatment of fractional shares.Northern will hold a special meeting of stockholders in the third quarter of 2020 to seek approval of proposals to authorize the reverse stock split and authorized share reduction. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at the special meeting is required to adopt and approve such proposals. Holders of record of Northern’s common stock as of the close of business on June 25, 2020, will be entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting. Northern has filed a preliminary proxy statement regarding the special meeting with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The reverse stock split and authorized share reduction are subject to market and other customary conditions, including stockholder approval. Northern reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to abandon the reverse stock split and authorized share reduction at any time prior to filing the applicable certificate of amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT PROPOSAL AND AUTHORIZED SHARE REDUCTION PROPOSALThis communication may be deemed to be solicitation material in connection with the proposal to be submitted to Northern’s stockholders at its special meeting seeking approval to effect a reverse stock split and authorized share reduction. In connection therewith, Northern has filed a preliminary proxy statement on Schedule 14A with the SEC. Stockholders are urged to read the preliminary proxy statement and all other relevant documents filed with the SEC when they become available, including the definitive proxy statement, because they will contain important information about the reverse stock split proposal and authorized share reduction proposal. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain the documents when available free of charge at the SEC’s website, www.sec.gov. In addition, stockholders may obtain free copies of the documents filed with the SEC when available at Northern’s website, www.NorthernOil.com. Information contained on such websites or that can be accessed through such websites does not constitute a part of this press release. PARTICIPANTS IN THE SOLICITATION Northern and its directors and executive officers may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from Northern’s stockholders in respect to the reverse stock split proposal and authorized share reduction proposal. Information about the directors and executive officers of Northern is set forth in Northern’s preliminary proxy statement, which was filed with the SEC on June 23, 2020. Investors may obtain additional information regarding the interests of Northern and its directors and executive officers in the reverse stock split proposal and authorized share reduction proposal by reading the preliminary proxy statement and, when it becomes available, the definitive proxy statement relating to the special meeting. SAFE HARBORThis press release contains forward-looking statements regarding future events and future results that are subject to the safe harbors created under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this release regarding Northern’s results of operations, business strategy, plans and objectives of management for future operations, actual or potential future production and cash flow, industry conditions, timing and benefits of pending acquisitions, and other matters are forward-looking statements. When used in this release, forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by terms or phrases such as “estimate,” “project,” “predict,” “believe,” “expect,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “target,” “could,” “plan,” “intend,” “seek,” “goal,” “will,” “should,” “may” or other words and similar expressions that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes.Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and important factors (many of which are beyond Northern’s control) that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements, including the following: the possibility that stockholder approval for the reverse stock split or authorized share reduction may not be obtained, the possibility that the reverse stock split or authorized share reduction may not have their intended effects, the possibility that factors unrelated to the reverse stock split or authorized share reduction may impact the per share trading price of Northern’s common stock, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic slowdown, changes in crude oil and natural gas prices, the pace of drilling and completions activity on Northern’s current properties and properties pending acquisition, Northern’s ability to acquire additional development opportunities, changes in Northern’s reserves estimates or the value thereof, general economic or industry conditions, nationally and/or in the communities in which Northern conducts business, changes in the interest rate environment, legislation or regulatory requirements, conditions of the securities markets, Northern’s ability to raise or access capital, changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines, financial or political instability, acts of war or terrorism, and other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and technical factors affecting Northern’s operations, products, services and prices. Additional information concerning potential factors that could affect future financial results is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, as updated from time to time in amendments and subsequent reports filed with the SEC.Northern has based these forward-looking statements on its current expectations and assumptions about future events. While management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond Northern’s control. Northern does not undertake any duty to update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as may be required by the federal securities laws.Item 9.01.

The authorization is effective until June 10, 2022 unless the total amount has been used or the authorization has been cancelled. “We are confident in OneSpan’s long-term strategy and this action by OneSpan’s Board of Directors intends to strengthen shareholder value with an additional tool in our balanced capital allocation approach,” said OneSpan Board Chairman, John Fox. “OneSpan will continue to prioritize growth investments, however with this authorization we have the flexibility to repurchase shares when beneficial given business and market conditions,” said OneSpan CEO, Scott Clements.As of June 30, 2020, OneSpan had approximately 40.3 million of ordinary shares outstanding. Share purchases under the repurchase program will take place in open market transactions or in privately negotiated transactions and may be made from time to time depending on market conditions, share price, trading volume, and other factors. The timing of the repurchases and the amount of stock repurchased in each transaction is subject to OneSpan’s sole discretion and will depend upon market and business conditions, applicable legal and credit requirements and other corporate considerations. Such purchases will be made in accordance with applicable U.S. securities laws and regulations. For all or a portion of the authorized repurchase amount, OneSpan may enter into a plan that is compliant with Rule 10b5-1 of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that is designed to facilitate these purchases.

On November 5, 2019, the Company issued a press release announcing the topline results from one of its Phase III studies of SPN-810 for the treatment of Impulsive Aggression (""IA"") in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (“ADHD”) patients 6 to 11 years old. The Phase III P301 trial in patients 6 to 11 years old did not meet its primary endpoint. The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multicenter, parallel group clinical trial in patients diagnosed with ADHD. Patients receiving SPN-810 36 mg showed a median percent reduction in the average weekly frequency of impulsive aggression episodes from baseline that was not statistically significant compared to placebo. These results are based on the combined analysis of data from stage 1 (interim analysis stage) and stage 2 (post interim analysis stage) in the study. In stage 1, the median percent reduction was statistically significant compared to placebo. However, in stage 2 of the study, post the interim analysis, the increase in variability in the 36mg treatment arm seems to have adversely impacted the results in the combined analysis. The median percent reduction in frequency of IA behavior in this Phase III study is consistent with the range of percent improvement in the retrospective modified aggression scale in the two positive treatment arms in the Phase IIb study. Overall, the trial exhibited favorable tolerability and safety profiles with low incidence of adverse events (AEs) across all doses. AEs were mild leading to low discontinuance rates for the 18mg, 36mg and combined treatment arms, respectively. The Company will stop enrollment in the Phase III P302 trial in patients 6 to 11 years old and analyze the data, which is expected to be available by the end of 2019. In the meantime, enrollment in the P503 Phase III trial (adolescents) is on hold until data from the P302 study are available and a final decision is reached regarding the SPN-810 program in IA.

The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in the forward-looking statements: business and economic conditions generally and in the bank and non-bank financial services industries, nationally and within our local market areas; the impact of COVID-19 on our business, including the impact of the actions taken by governmental authorities to try and contain the virus or address the impact of the virus on the United States economy (including, without limitation, the CARES Act), and the resulting effect of all of such items on our operations, liquidity and capital position, and on the financial condition of our borrowers and other customers; our ability to mitigate our risk exposures; our ability to maintain our historical earnings trends; changes in management personnel; interest rate risk; concentration of our products and services in the transportation industry; credit risk associated with our loan portfolio; lack of seasoning in our loan portfolio; deteriorating asset quality and higher loan charge-offs; time and effort necessary to resolve nonperforming assets; inaccuracy of the assumptions and estimates we make in establishing reserves for probable loan losses and other estimates; risks related to the integration of acquired businesses, including our acquisition of HubTran Inc. and developments related to our acquisition of Transport Financial Solutions and the related over-formula advances, and any future acquisitions; our ability to successfully identify and address the risks associated with our possible future acquisitions, and the risks that our prior and possible future acquisitions make it more difficult for investors to evaluate our business, financial condition and results of operations, and impairs our ability to accurately forecast our future performance; lack of liquidity; fluctuations in the fair value and liquidity of the securities we hold for sale; impairment of investment securities, goodwill, other intangible assets or deferred tax assets; our risk management strategies; environmental liability associated with our lending activities; increased competition in the bank and non-bank financial services industries, nationally, regionally or locally, which may adversely affect pricing and terms; the accuracy of our financial statements and related disclosures; material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting; system failures or failures to prevent breaches of our network security; the institution and outcome of litigation and other legal proceedings against us or to which we become subject; changes in carry-forwards of net operating losses; changes in federal tax law or policy; the impact of recent and future legislative and regulatory changes, including changes in banking, securities and tax laws and regulations, such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) and their application by our regulators; governmental monetary and fiscal policies; changes in the scope and cost of FDIC, insurance and other coverages; failure to receive regulatory approval for future acquisitions; and increases in our capital requirements.While forward-looking statements reflect our good-faith beliefs, they are not guarantees of future performance. All forward-looking statements are necessarily only estimates of future results. Accordingly, actual results may differ materially from those expressed in or contemplated by the particular forward-looking statement, and, therefore, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events or circumstances, except as required by applicable law. For a discussion of such risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements, see “Risk Factors” and the forward-looking statement disclosure contained in Triumph’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 12, 2021.Item 9.01.Financial Statements and Exhibits(d)Exhibits.ExhibitDescription99.1Press release, dated January 20, 202299.2Triumph Bancorp, Inc.

The Idaho settlement agreement does not change the Company's previous total estimated financial commitments of approximately $74 million among all jurisdictions.The settlement in principle also provides for Hydro One and Avista Corp. to support accelerating the depreciation schedule for Colstrip Units 3 and 4 to reflect a remaining useful life of those units through December 31, 2027. However, funding for this commitment will be addressed in three existing, interrelated IPUC proceedings that are separate from the merger proceeding, which are the Company's filing associated with the federal income tax law changes, the Company's request to change depreciation rates and the Company's 2019 Electric Integrated Resource Plan. In addition, included in the financial commitments described above is funding toward a Colstrip community transition fund which is intended to help the Colstrip community transition from coal-fired generation in the event of a future closure. The settlement in principle does not reflect any agreement with respect to the ultimate closure of Units 3 and 4 as that decision would be made in conjunction with the other owners of Colstrip.The settlement agreement is subject to IPUC approval and the parties have requested approval from the IPUC by August 14, 2018.In addition to Hydro One and Avista Corp., the parties to the merger proceeding in Idaho include IPUC Staff, Idaho Forest Group, Clearwater Paper Corporation, Community Action Partnership Association of Idaho, Idaho Conservation League and the Washington and Northern Idaho District Council of Laborers.Hydro One and Avista Corp. received antitrust clearance on April 6, 2018 after the expiration of the applicable waiting period under the U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended.

93,93,,AVA,0000104918-18-000102,2018-08-10,"Item8.01 Other Events.In March 2016, the Public Counsel Section of the Washington Attorney General’s Office (Public Counsel) filed a Petition for Judicial Review of the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission's (WUTC) January 2016 order (Order 05) that concluded Avista Corporation’s (Avista Corp. or the Company) electric and natural gas general rate cases that were originally filed with the WUTC in February 2015. Order 05 approved new electric and natural gas rates that became effective on January 11, 2016. The new rates were designed to provide an $8.1 million decrease in electric base revenue and a $10.8 million increase in natural gas base revenue.Public Counsel requested that the Washington State Court of Appeals (Court) (1) vacate or set aside portions of the WUTC’s orders; (2) identify errors contained in the WUTC’s orders; (3) find that the rates approved in Order 05 and reaffirmed in a subsequent order were unlawful and not fair, just and reasonable; (4) remand the matter to the WUTC for further proceedings consistent with these rulings, including a determination of our revenue requirement for electric and natural gas services; and (5) find the customers are entitled to a refund.On August 7, 2018, the Court issued a ""Published Opinion"" (Opinion) which concluded that the WUTC's use of an attrition allowance to calculate Avista Corp.'s rate base violated Washington law. In the Opinion, the Court stated that because the projected additions to rate base in the future were not ""used and useful"" for service at the time the request for the rate increase was made, they may not lawfully be included in the Company's rate base to justify a rate increase. Accordingly, the WUTC erred in including an attrition allowance in the calculation of Avista Corp.’s electric and natural gas rate base. The Court noted, however, that the law does not prohibit an attrition allowance in the calculation, for rate-making purposes, of recoverable operating and maintenance expense. Since the WUTC order provided one lump sum attrition allowance without distinguishing what portion was for rate base and which was for operating and maintenance expenses or other considerations, the Court struck all portions of the attrition allowance attributable to the Company's rate base and reversed and remanded the case for the WUTC to recalculate Avista Corp.’s rates without including an attrition allowance in the calculation of rate base.The Company cannot predict the outcome of this matter at this time, but given the Opinion issued by the Court, the Company will participate in any regulatory process that is yet to be established by the WUTC.",8.01,2018-07-27,40.747352600097656,2018-08-24,41.81858444213867,-0.0219673782788166,-0.001005843874346,2018-08-10,8.01,2018-07-27,2018-08-24,-0.0219673688009727,43.59643173217773,43.674583435058594,43.91770553588867,43.82219314575195,43.85691452026367,43.952430725097656,44.12608337402344,44.02189254760742,43.94374847412109,44.09135055541992,44.01321029663086,44.00453186035156,44.29105758666992,44.37788772583008,44.53417205810547,44.7946662902832,44.42998123168945,44.5949592590332,44.655738830566406,44.68178939819336,44.7425651550293,0.0262896153954182,0.0482569841963909,"In March 2016, the Public Counsel Section of the Washington Attorney General’s Office (Public Counsel) filed a Petition for Judicial Review.

Our compensation plans are designed to focus NEOs on goals that align with business strategy, operating performance and shareholder values. In support of our philosophy, performance-based awards pay out only when pre-determined results are achieved. The 2018 cash EIP Awards were determined based on the achievement of pre-established performance measures set by the Committee under the shareholder-approved Company 2014 Stock and Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) and the Executive Incentive Plan (EIP). The 2019 base salaries of Mark A. Rossi and Mary E. Sellers remain unchanged from their base salaries approved in 2018. The base salaries of Peter S. Ho, Dean Y. Shigemura, and James C. Polk will be increased to $825,000, $400,000 and $400,000 respectively commencing on April 1, 2019.On February 22, 2019, the Committee also awarded Restricted Stock Grants (“RSGs”) to the Company’s 5 NEOs pursuant to the terms of the Plan. The RSGs awarded to the NEOs are shown in the table below:GRANTEERSGsPeter S. Ho26,542Dean Y. Shigemura6,033James C. Polk6,033Mark A. Rossi6,033Mary E. Sellers6,033These performance-based RSGs were made pursuant to individual Restricted Stock Grant Agreements, which provide for cliff vesting to occur after a three-year performance period, 2019, 2020 and 2021, and terminates on the date of certification of achievement of service and financial performance objectives by the Committee. The specified 3 year financial performance criteria are related to the Company’s Return on Equity, Stock Price to Book Ratio and Tier 1 Capital Ratio, weighted at 45%, 45% and 10% respectively, as compared to designated Peer Group performance as more particularly described in the form Restricted Stock Grant Agreement which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1. The three-year performance period and cliff vesting schedule directly tie to the Company’s long-term executive retention and performance goals. This summary of the provisions of the RSG is qualified in its entirety by the actual copy of the form Restricted Stock Grant Agreement.Item 9.01.

101,101,,CAL,0000014707-19-000026,2019-05-22,"Item8.01. Other Events.The Company has announced that it has changed its management reporting and segment presentation to better align with its developing business model. The Company will continue to present two reportable segments: Famous Footwear and Brand Portfolio. Beginning with the first quarter of 2019, the Company will present the net sales of the Brand Portfolio segment inclusive of both external and intersegment sales, with the elimination of intersegment sales and profit from Brand Portfolio to Famous Footwear reflected within the “Eliminations and Other"" category. This change reflects the independent business models of both Brand Portfolio and Famous Footwear, as well as growth in intersegment activity driven by recent acquisitions. In 2018, the Company acquired the Blowfish Malibu and Vionic businesses, both of which are brands sold to its Famous Footwear segment. The Company’s first quarter 2019 results will reflect the new presentation, and prior year amounts have been recast to conform to the new presentation. There is no change to the consolidated financial results. The supplemental information included in Exhibit 99.1 updates the Company’s unaudited historical business segment information for 2017 and 2018 to reflect the change in reportable operating segments. The change in segments will be reflected retrospectively; however, there is no impact on the Company’s previously reported consolidated balance sheets, or consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, cash flows and shareholders’ equity.On May 22, 2019, the Company issued a press release (the “Press Release”) announcing the segment change and historical results for fiscal years 2017 and 2018.

H.R.1, among other items, reduces the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. As such, First Commonwealth Financial Corporation (""Corporation"") is completing a revaluation of the Corporation's net deferred tax assets. The Corporation's deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, represent expected corporate tax benefits anticipated to be realized in the future. The reduction in the federal corporate tax rate reduces these benefits. The Corporation is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of H.R.1 and has preliminarily estimated a reduction in the Corporation's deferred tax asset of approximately $16.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, representing approximately ($0.17) per diluted share based on estimated fourth quarter weighted average diluted shares of approximately 97.5 million. The Corporation's revaluation of its deferred tax asset is subject to further clarifications of the new law that cannot be estimated at this time. As such, the Corporation is unable to make a final determination of the impact on the quarterly and year-to-date earnings for the period ending December 31, 2017 at this time, and, therefore, the reduction of the Corporation's deferred tax asset may vary materially from the estimated amount. The Corporation does not anticipate future cash expenditures as a result of the reduction to the net deferred tax asset. Forward-looking statementsThis Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements regarding the Corporation's outlook and expectations with respect to the enactment of H.R.1, effective January 1, 2018, including the expected impact of H.R.1 on the Corporation's deferred tax assets, the impact of the revaluation of the deferred tax assets on the Corporation's fourth quarter 2017 earnings and that the Corporation does not anticipate future cash expenditures as a result of the reduction in the deferred tax assets. Words and phrases such as “anticipates,” “expects,” “believes,” “plans,” “estimates,” “will,” and variations of such words and phrases or similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Such statements are based upon current beliefs and expectations. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future financial performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions (“risk factors”) that are difficult to predict with regard to timing, extent, likelihood and degree of occurrence. Therefore, actual results and outcomes may materially differ from what may be expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. Risks factors include, without limitation, uncertainties in the Corporation's preliminary review of, and additional analysis with respect to, the impact of H.R.1 on the Corporation's deferred tax asset, as well as additional risks and uncertainties included in the risk factors described in Item 1A of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. These and other factors are representative of the risk factors that may emerge and could cause a difference between an ultimate actual outcome and a preceding forward-looking statement. The Corporation assumes no duty to update, amend or clarify forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

On February 22, 2018, the Compensation & Human Resources Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors of First Commonwealth Financial Corporation (the “Company”) approved an Annual Incentive Plan for 2018 (“AIP”) and a Long-Term Incentive Plan for 2018 through 2020 and awards under the AIP and LTIP to the Company’s named executive officers (“NEOs”). The awards under the AIP and LTIP are subject to the Company’s Amended and Restated Incentive Compensation Plan (the “Plan”).Annual Incentive PlanUnder the AIP, each NEO has the opportunity to earn a cash award equal to a percentage of his or her base salary subject to the attainment of corporate performance goals and, in the case of risk management executives, an individual performance component, for the 2018 fiscal year. The performance goals under the AIP and their weightings are as follows:MeasureCEO & Other Participant WeightingsRisk Management Participant Weightings1Core ROA25%15%Core EPS50%40%Core Efficiency Ratio25%15%Individual performance  componentN/A30%________________1 Risk Management participants includes the Chief Credit Officer, Chief Risk Officer and Chief Audit Executive. The AIP establishes “threshold,” “target” and “superior” levels of performance for each goal and a target award opportunity that is expressed as a percentage of the participant’s base salary. Performance at the threshold level would result in a payout equal to 25% of the target award; performance at the target level would result in a payout equal to 100% of the target award; and performance at the superior level would result in a payout equal to 150% of the target award. Payout percentages are interpolated if actual corporate performance for a goal falls between threshold and target or between target and superior levels. In addition, the Committee has the discretion to increase or decrease an executive’s incentive payment by up to 25 percentage points, not to exceed the maximum payout of 150% of target.The following table sets forth the estimated target award for each NEO under the AIP based on current salaries:OfficerTarget AwardT.

The time-based units will vest on February 22, 2021, subject to continued service by the executive through the vesting date. The performance-based units are subject to vesting based on the attainment of the following equally-weighted corporate performance goals: (1) core return on tangible common equity compared to peers (“Relative ROTCE”), and (2) total return to shareholders compared to peers (“Relative TRS”). The time-based restricted stock units and target performance-based restricted stock unit awards for each NEO under the LTIP are as follows:OfficerTime-Based Restricted Stock UnitsTarget Performance-Based Restricted Stock UnitsT.

A copy of the October 25, 2021 press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2. Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure The Company previously announced that it will host an investor conference call on Tuesday, October 26, 2021 at 9:30 a.m. Pacific Time / 12:30 p.m. Eastern Time to review financial results for its third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2021. A presentation to accompany the conference call, which contains certain historical and forward-looking information relating to the Company (the “Presentation Materials”), has been made available at the Investor Relations section of Hope Bancorp’s website at www.ir-hopebancorp.com. A copy of the Presentation Materials is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.3. The information included in this report pursuant to Item 2.02, Item 8.01 and Item 7.01 of Form 8-K (including Exhibit 99.1, Exhibit 99.2 and Exhibit 99.3) shall not be deemed to be “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act.The following risk factor supplements the “Risk Factors” section in our 2020 Form 10-K. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and the further impact will depend on future developments that cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, impact of the different variants of the virus, the economic implications of the same, and the actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic.The novel COVID-19 pandemic has substantially and negatively impacted the United States economy, disrupted global supply chains, considerably lowered equity market valuations, created significant volatility and disruption in the financial markets, and materially increased unemployment levels. In addition, certain industries to which the Company has considerable exposure, including hospitality and retail, are expected to require a longer recovery period from the temporary pandemic-related restrictions on business operations. As a result, the demand for our products and services has been and likely will continue to be significantly impacted, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the pandemic could result in the recognition of amplified credit losses in our loan portfolios and increases in our allowance for loan losses, particularly if a rise in COVID-19 cases results in a return to business closures and lockdowns. Similarly, because of changing economic and market conditions, we may be required to recognize impairments on goodwill or the securities we hold. Our business operations may also be further disrupted if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of challenges arising as a result of circumstances related to working from home, illness, quarantines, government actions, or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic. In response to the pandemic, we have also suspended residential property foreclosure sales and evictions, and previously offered payment deferrals and other expanded assistance for credit card, mortgage and small business lending customers, and future governmental actions may require these and other types of customer-related responses. In addition, we may take capital actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will depend on future developments that cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, impact of the different variants of the virus, the economic implications of the same and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic.

Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.Director ResignationsOn October 8, 2018, each of Kai O. Öistämö and Jeffrey K. Belk notified InterDigital, Inc. (“InterDigital” or the “Company”), of his respective intentions to resign from the Company’s Board of Directors (“Board”) effective immediately in order to assume new roles at the Company. Neither Mr. Öistämö’s nor Mr. Belk’s decision to resign from the Board is due to any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company’s operations, policies or practices. As announced by the Company on October 11, 2018, Mr. Öistämö has resigned from the Board to assume the role of Chief Operating Officer at the Company, and Mr. Belk has resigned from the Board to assume the role of Executive Vice President, Business Development, at the Company. As a result of the resignations of Messrs. Öistämö and Belk from the Board, the size of the Company’s Board has been reduced from nine to seven members.Appointment of Chief Operating OfficerEffective October 10, 2018, Mr. Öistämö, 54, has been appointed to serve as the company’s Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Öistämö previously served as a director on the Board from November 2014 through the date of his resignation on October 8, 2018. From September 2016 to October 2018, Mr. Öistämö was an Executive Partner at Siris Capital, a private equity firm, which he initially joined in October 2015 as an advisor. Mr. Öistämö led corporate strategy and business development at Nokia Corporation (“Nokia”), a leader in the fields of network infrastructure, location-based technologies and advanced technologies and a wireless handset manufacturer, as Executive Vice President, Chief Development Officer, from 2010 until his departure in 2014, with responsibility for strategic partnerships and alliances. Mr. Öistämö was also a member of the Nokia leadership team from 2005 to 2014. Mr. Öistämö has served on the board of directors of Sanoma Corporation, a Finnish public company, since 2011. There is no arrangement or understanding between Mr. Öistämö and any other persons pursuant to which Mr. Öistämö was selected as an officer, and Mr. Öistämö is not related to any officer or director of the Company. There have been no transactions involving Mr. Öistämö or his immediate family members that require disclosure pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Pursuant to the terms of his offer letter dated October 10, 2018, Mr. Öistämö will receive the following components of compensation: (i) an annual base salary in the amount of $600,000; (ii) a target short-term incentive plan payout of 75% of his annual base salary for 2018; (iii) a $1,100,000 sign-on cash bonus payable in four equal installments: upon hire, at December 31, 2018, at July 1, 2019, and at December 31, 2019; (iv) a target award equal to $3,000,000 under the Company’s 2018 long-term compensation program (“LTCP”), comprised of one-third time-based restricted stock units (“RSUs”), one-third performance-based RSUs (“PSUs”) and one-third performance-based stock options; (v) a sign-on performance-based stock option award equal in value to $700,000 and having the same terms and conditions as the performance-based stock option award granted for the 2018 LTCP, as discussed further below; and (vi) a taxable yearly stipend of $100,000 to compensate Mr. Öistämö for expenses related to his travel between his home and the Company’s offices in Wilmington, Delaware. The time-based RSUs to be granted to Mr. Öistämö under the 2018 LTCP will vest on March 15, 2021, assuming continued service through such date except as set forth below. Both the 2018 LTCP PSUs and performance-based stock options to be granted to Mr. Öistämö will vest, assuming continued service through such date except as set forth below, on March 15, 2023 (with a threshold payout of 50% of target and a maximum payout of 200% of target), subject to the achievement of revenue and earnings performance goals measured as of December 31, 2022; however, to the extent that all or a portion of the performance goals in excess of the threshold have been achieved as measured as of December 31, 2020, such performance-based awards will vest, to the extent applicable, on March 15, 2021, and the remaining unvested portion of such performance-based awards, if any, shall then remain eligible to vest on March 15, 2023, subject to the achievement of the performance goals measured as of December 31, 2022.If Mr. Öistämö’s employment is terminated by the Company or any parent, subsidiary, or affiliate of the Company without Cause (as defined in the Company’s Executive Severance and Change in Control Policy, or the “Policy,” which was adopted on October 5, 2018, and is described below) or by reason of his death or disability, in each case, during the last year of the performance period, the PSUs will vest as to a prorated portion (based on the number of days he was employed during the applicable performance period) of the number of PSUs that would have otherwise become vested according to actual performance during the performance period and, in each case, during the last year of a performance period for his performance-based stock options, the performance-based stock options will vest as to a prorated portion (based on the number of days he was employed during the applicable performance period) of the number of stock options that would have otherwise become vested according to actual performance over the applicable performance period. Additionally, the time-based RSUs will vest as to a prorated portion (based on the number of days he was employed during the applicable vesting period). In the event of a termination without Cause, the prorated vesting is conditioned upon Mr. Öistämö’s execution of a release of claims in favor of the Company within 60 days following termination of employment. In addition, upon such a termination of Mr. Öistämö’s employment, the performance-based stock options will remain exercisable for six months after the date the administrator of the Company’s 2017 Equity Incentive Plan determines the extent to which the performance goals for the applicable performance period have been achieved. If Mr. Öistämö’s employment is terminated within one year following a Change in Control, either by the Company other than for Cause, death, or disability or by Mr. Öistämö for Good Reason (as such terms are defined in the Policy), 100% of the then-unvested portion of his time-based and performance-based awards will vest upon termination, subject to his execution of a release of claims in favor of the Company within 60 days following termination of employment.In addition, Mr. Öistämö may not dispose of or transfer any shares he acquires through the exercise of his performance-based stock options until the earlier of (i) the end of the two-year period following the date of vesting or (ii) a Change in Control. All of the equity grants to Mr. Öistämö will be made under the Company's 2017 Equity Incentive Plan. The grants of the time-based RSU awards will be made pursuant to the form of agreement for such awards that will be filed as an exhibit to the Company’s forthcoming quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 (the “Q3 10-Q”). The PSU awards and performance-based stock option awards will have the terms set forth on the term sheets for such awards previously filed as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, to the Company Current Report on Form 8-K dated July 9, 2018, and will otherwise be subject to the standard terms and conditions for PSU awards and for stock option awards, respectively, that are part of the forms of agreement for such awards, which will be also filed as exhibits to the Q3 10-Q. The forms of agreement to be filed as exhibits to the Q3 10-Q do not differ from the forms of agreement previously filed as Exhibits 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K dated June 16, 2017, except that the definitions of Cause and Good Reason have been revised to provide that such terms have the meanings set forth in the Policy, when applicable. Additionally, Mr. Öistämö has also been designated as a Tier 1 participant in the Policy, and he is therefore eligible for the benefits described below.The summary of Mr. Öistämö’s offer letter set forth above does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such document. The Company will file Mr. Öistämö’s offer letter as an exhibit to the Q3 10-Q. Mr. Öistämö will remain a party to an indemnity agreement in substantially the form of the Company’s form of indemnity agreement filed as Exhibit 10.47 to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of InterDigital Communications Corporation for the quarter ended March 31, 2003. Adoption of Executive Severance and Change in Control PolicyOn October 5, 2018, the Compensation Committee of the Board adopted the Policy. Each of our named executive officers, as set forth in the Company's most recently filed proxy statement, will be offered participation in the Policy. The Policy has an initial term of three years and automatically renews for additional one‑year terms, unless we provide notice of non‑renewal at least 30 days prior to the date of the automatic renewal, and except that any term may be automatically extended upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, as defined in the Policy, or an act or omission constituting Good Reason, as defined in the Policy. The Policy provides for two tiers of participation: Tier 1 and Tier 2. Currently, each of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer has been designated as a Tier 1 participant, and each of our other named executive officers has been designated as a Tier 2 participant. To become a participant in the Policy, an employee needs to be designated by the Compensation Committee and sign a participation agreement under the Policy. We currently expect that each named executive officer will be a participant of the Policy as of the expiration of his or her employment agreement, as described in greater detail below.Under the Policy, if we terminate a participant’s employment other than for Cause, death or Disability (as such terms are defined in the Policy) any time other than during the period from upon to until 12 months following a Change in Control (the “Change in Control Period”), such participant will be eligible to receive the following severance benefits, less applicable tax withholdings: •continued payments of base salary for 18 months for a Tier 2 participant (30 months for a Tier 1 participant);•a lump sum cash amount equal to 150% of the cost of 12 months of COBRA premiums for a Tier 2 participant and his or her covered dependents (or 18 months for a Tier 1 participant); and•reasonable outplacement services in accordance with any applicable Company policy in effect as of such participant’s termination of employment (or if no such policy is in effect, as determined by the Company, in its sole discretion, provided that such outplacement services are provided by qualified consultants selected by the Company, at its expense, in an amount not to exceed $10,000).Further, under the Policy, if we terminate a participant’s employment other than for Cause, death or Disability or if the participant resigns for Good Reason, during the Change in Control Period, such participant will be eligible to receive the following lump sum cash severance benefits, less applicable tax withholdings:•an amount equal to 200% of the Tier 2 participant’s base salary (or 300% for a Tier 1 participant);•an amount equal to 100% of the participant’s target bonus under our short-term incentive plan; and•an amount equal to 150% of the cost of 24 months of COBRA premiums for the participant and his or her covered dependents.To receive the severance benefits upon a qualifying termination, either in connection with or not in connection with a Change in Control, a participant must sign and not revoke the Company’s standard separation agreement and release of claims within the timeframe set forth in the Policy and must continue to adhere to his or her nondisclosure and assignment of ideas agreement.By becoming a participant in the Policy, such participation supersedes any other prior severance and/or change in control benefit, whether in an employment letter or another severance plan or policy, except that existing rights to equity acceleration will continue to be governed by the existing arrangements currently in place.If any of the payments provided for under the Policy or otherwise payable to a participant would constitute “parachute payments” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code and would be subject to the related excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, then the participant will be entitled to receive either full payment of benefits or such lesser amount that would result in no portion of the benefits being subject to the excise tax, whichever results in the greater amount of after-tax benefits to the participant.The summary of the Policy set forth above does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Policy. The Company will file the Policy as an exhibit to the Q3 10-Q. Non-Renewal of Named Executive Officer Employment AgreementsEach of our named executive officers is a party to an employment agreement with the Company that provides for severance pay and benefits, among other things, in certain events of termination of employment. The employment agreement with each named executive officer provides for an initial employment term of two years, which term automatically renews for additional successive one-year periods (unless either party provides notice of non-renewal at least 90 days before the expiration of the term (as extended by any renewal period)). In the event that a Change in Control (as defined in the employment agreement) occurs at any time during the term, then the term shall extend for an additional year and 90 days from the date of the Change in Control, provided such extension serves to lengthen the term that would otherwise have been in place.On October 5, 2018, and in connection with the Company’s adoption of the Policy, the Compensation Committee approved that notice of non-renewal be made to each named executive officer. Accordingly, each named executive officer employment agreement will expire on January 20, 2019, and, thereafter, each named executive officer will be eligible for benefits under the Policy.

The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) in an aggregate principal amount of $200 million, which includes a $50 million letter of credit sub-limit. Borrowings under the Credit Facility may be used by the Company for general corporate purposes and working capital. The Credit Agreement provides that the Borrower may increase the size of the facility, either in the form of additional revolving commitments or new term loans, subject to the discretion of each lender to participate in such increase, up to an additional amount of $100 million. The Credit Facility will mature on October 15, 2026 and provides the Company with the right to request that the lenders extend the maturity date for two additional periods of one year each, subject to customary conditions. As of the effective date of the Credit Agreement, there were no borrowings outstanding thereunder.The Credit Agreement replaces that certain Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of December 19, 2017 (as amended, the “Existing Credit Agreement”), among the Company, as borrower, certain subsidiaries of the Company party thereto, as borrowers or guarantors, the lenders party thereto from time to time and Wells Fargo Capital Finance, LLC, as administrative agent. In connection therewith, on October 15, 2021, the Existing Credit Agreement was terminated and is no longer in effect.Interest on outstanding indebtedness under the Credit Facility accrues at a rate equal to, at the Company’s option, (A) the highest of (i) Wells Fargo Bank, National Association’s prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (iii) except when LIBOR is unavailable, LIBOR plus 1.00%; plus an applicable margin based upon the Company’s consolidated net lease adjusted leverage ratio from time to time; or (B) if available, LIBOR plus an applicable margin based upon the Company’s consolidated net lease adjusted leverage ratio from time to time. The Credit Agreement includes customary LIBOR replacement language.The Credit Facility requires compliance with conditions precedent that must be satisfied prior to any borrowing as well as ongoing compliance with certain affirmative and negative covenants to which the Company and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries must adhere. The affirmative covenants include, but are not limited to: maintenance of existence; insurance; accounting methods and financial records; payment of taxes; compliance with laws; visits and inspections; additional guarantors; and use of proceeds. The negative covenants include, but are not limited to, restrictions on the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to: create, incur, assume or suffer to exist indebtedness except in certain circumstances; create, incur, assume or suffer to exist liens on properties except in certain circumstances; make or pay dividends or distributions on the Company’s stock except in certain circumstances; merge, liquidate, dissolve or dispose of substantially all of its assets subject to certain ordinary course and other exceptions; and transact with any affiliate except on arm’s length terms and other exceptions. In addition, the Company is obligated to maintain (i) a consolidated net lease adjusted leverage ratio not greater than 3.50 to 1.00 (which may increase to 3.75 to 1.00 for four consecutive fiscal quarters upon the consummation of certain material acquisitions); and (ii) a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio equal to or greater than 1.75 to 1.00; both as calculated in accordance with the terms and definitions determining such ratios contained in the Credit Agreement (together, the “Financial Covenants”). The Credit Agreement also contains various information and reporting requirements. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, including, but not limited to, a cross-default to certain other debt, breaches of representations and warranties, change in control events and breaches of covenants. The obligations under the Credit Agreement are required to be guaranteed by certain of the Company’s wholly owned domestic subsidiaries (other than certain immaterial subsidiaries).The lenders under the Credit Agreement and their affiliates have provided and may, from time to time, continue to provide investment banking, financial advisory and other services to the Company, for which they have received customary fees and reimbursement of expenses, and for which they expect to receive customary fees and reimbursement of expenses, respectively.The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Credit Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 4.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference. Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Credit Agreement.Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.The information set forth above under Item 1.01 is incorporated herein by reference.Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.The information set forth above under Item 1.01 is incorporated herein by reference.Item 3.03 Material Modification to Rights of Security Holders.The Credit Agreement described under Item 1.01 allows the Company to pay dividends, repurchase its shares and make certain other distributions from time to time, so long as at the time of such dividend, repurchase or distribution, the Company is not in Default (and no Default or Event of Default would result from paying the dividend, repurchasing the shares or making the distribution) and it would be in compliance with the Financial Covenants (as of the date specified in the Credit Agreement). Currently, the Credit Agreement would not prohibit the Company from paying dividends. The future payment of dividends is within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other factors, our earnings, capital requirements, and operating and financial condition, as well as the Financial Covenants under the Credit Agreement.Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
